The Fast & Furious franchise has one of the most confusing watch orders in cinema history. A timeline that starts in 2001 Los Angeles, detours to Tokyo, jumps to the Dominican Republic, eventually goes to space, and ends (almost) with Fast X — you need a guide.

This is the **definitive Fast and Furious watch order for 2026**, including the Tokyo Drift timeline problem, the short films, where to stream everything, and how to prepare for the franchise finale.

## The Short Answer: Which Order?

**First-time viewers**: **Release date order** — it preserves surprises and follows character arcs as originally intended.

**Re-watch or franchise fans**: **Chronological order** — the Tokyo Drift placement makes far more sense and Han's arc becomes coherent.

**In a rush**: Watch **The Fast and the Furious, Fast Five, Furious 7** — the best entry points and the emotional peaks of the franchise.

## Option 1: Release Date Order (Best for First-Timers)

| # | Film | Year | Runtime |
|---|------|------|---------|
| 1 | The Fast and the Furious | 2001 | 110 min |
| 2 | 2 Fast 2 Furious | 2003 | 107 min |
| 3 | The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift | 2006 | 104 min |
| 4 | Fast & Furious | 2009 | 107 min |
| 5 | Fast Five | 2011 | 130 min |
| 6 | Fast & Furious 6 | 2013 | 130 min |
| 7 | Furious 7 | 2015 | 137 min |
| 8 | The Fate of the Furious | 2017 | 136 min |
| 9 | Hobbs & Shaw | 2019 | 137 min |
| 10 | F9: The Fast Saga | 2021 | 143 min |
| 11 | Fast X | 2023 | 141 min |

**Total runtime**: approximately 22.5 hours

### Why Release Order Works for First Timers

Release order follows the franchise's evolution — from street racing crime drama (films 1–3) through heist action (4–6) into superhero-scale blockbuster (7–11). You experience the tonal shifts as they happened, and surprises land properly.

The main drawback: Tokyo Drift appears third even though it's set much later in the story. Han — who dies in Tokyo Drift — then appears alive in films 4–6, which is confusing unless you know the franchise retroactively explained this as "Justice for Han."

---

## Option 2: Chronological Story Order (Best for Re-Watches)

This is how the events actually unfold within the franchise's internal timeline:

### 1. The Fast and the Furious (2001)

The one that started everything. LAPD officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) goes undercover to investigate street racer Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) — and finds himself respecting the man he's supposed to arrest. The original is a surprisingly grounded crime thriller: small stakes, genuine character work, and street racing that feels real rather than cartoonish.

The relationship between Brian and Dom — two men on opposite sides of the law who recognize something in each other — is the emotional engine of the entire franchise.

- **Stream on**: Peacock, Tubi
- **Best scene**: The first quarter-mile race; the heist sequence

### 2. Turbo-Charged Prelude (Short Film, 2003) — Optional

A 6-minute short bridging the first film and *2 Fast 2 Furious*, following Brian's cross-country drive from LA to Miami after the events of the original. Available on YouTube. Optional viewing, but completionists will want it.

### 3. 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)

Without Vin Diesel (who didn't return for the sequel), *2 Fast 2 Furious* leans into Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner and introduces Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) — who becomes one of the franchise's most beloved recurring characters. Brian and Roman go undercover in Miami to take down a drug lord.

Sillier than the original but genuinely fun, and Roman's comedic energy is a preview of what the franchise becomes.

- **Stream on**: Peacock, Tubi
- **Best scene**: The bridge jump; any scene where Roman complains about the plan

### 4. Los Bandoleros (Short Film, 2009) — Optional

A 20-minute short set in the Dominican Republic, showing what Dom has been doing between the first film and *Fast & Furious* (2009). Directed by Vin Diesel himself, it introduces several characters from the fourth film and establishes Han's relationship with Dom's crew.

Available on YouTube and as a DVD special feature.

### 5. Fast & Furious (2009)

Dom and Brian reunite as the franchise resets its tone. After a tragedy brings Dom back to LA, he and Brian find themselves working with the FBI to take down a heroin cartel with connections to Dom's past. The fourth film is darker than the first three and marks the point where the franchise commits fully to family as its central theme.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Key development**: Brian and Dom officially working together as partners for the first time

### 6. Fast Five (2011)

The turning point. In Rio de Janeiro, Dom's entire crew assembles for an epic heist against a corrupt businessman — and Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is sent to bring them in. **Fast Five** is the film that transformed a car-racing franchise into an action heist blockbuster. It's also genuinely great cinema: the vault chase finale is extraordinary.

This is where many people who gave up on the franchise after Tokyo Drift should return. *Fast Five* is so much better than what came before that it's almost a different franchise.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Best scene**: The vault drag through Rio — one of the greatest action sequences of the decade
- **Key development**: The full "Fast Family" assembled for the first time

### 7. Fast & Furious 6 (2013)

The crew is recruited by Hobbs to help dismantle a mercenary operation in exchange for full pardons. The film expands the action to London and introduces Shaw — the first of the franchise's truly theatrical villains. An important connective piece that sets up Furious 7.

The **mid-credits scene** of *Fast & Furious 6* is actually set in Tokyo and shows Han's fate at the hands of Deckard Shaw — connecting *Tokyo Drift* to the main timeline.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Watch for**: The mid-credits scene (set in Tokyo, with Jason Statham)

### 8. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

**Placed here chronologically** — after *Fast & Furious 6*. Sean Moseley, a reckless teenager from the US, is sent to live with his father in Tokyo and gets pulled into the underground drift racing scene under the mentorship of veteran racer Han.

*Tokyo Drift* works much better here than in its release position — Han's fate makes sense, Dom's cameo in the finale lands properly, and the film's ending connects naturally to Furious 7.

Standalone, it's actually an underrated film: the drift racing sequences are visually inventive, and it has the most distinct aesthetic of any film in the franchise.

- **Stream on**: Peacock, Tubi
- **Key development**: Establishes Han's backstory; the "Justice for Han" storyline begins here

### 9. Furious 7 (2015)

Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) targets Dom's family for revenge. The film became one of the highest-grossing of all time — not just for its action, but for its extraordinary real-world context: Paul Walker died in a car accident during production, and the film's farewell to his character Brian O'Conner is one of cinema's most genuinely moving endings.

The parachute car sequence, the parking garage fight, the helicopter assault — Furious 7 is the action peak of the franchise. The "See You Again" ending is the emotional peak.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Best scene**: The final farewell sequence — bring tissues
- **Key development**: Brian's story concluded; Han arc addressed (partially)

### 10. The Fate of the Furious (2017)

Dom is mysteriously turned against his family and works for a cyberterrorist called Cipher (Charlize Theron). Hobbs and Shaw find themselves working together despite their antagonism. The franchise's ambitions reach their peak — submarine chase, nuclear sub, global conspiracies.

More divisive than earlier entries, but Charlize Theron makes for a compelling villain and the action sequences remain spectacular.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Best scene**: The zombie car attack in New York City

### 11. Hobbs & Shaw (2019)

A spinoff following Dwayne Johnson's Hobbs and Jason Statham's Shaw as reluctant partners against a genetically enhanced supervillain (Idris Elba). **Hobbs & Shaw** is a lighter, sillier film than the main series — more aware of its own absurdity. Perfectly enjoyable as franchise entertainment.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Best for**: Dwayne Johnson fans, viewers who want the franchise's fun without its emotional baggage

### 12. F9: The Fast Saga (2021)

Dom's long-estranged brother Jakob (John Cena) emerges as the new threat. The franchise reaches peak self-parody: a car goes to actual outer space. F9 is the most divisive entry in the main series — the space sequence either makes you laugh or lose faith, depending on your relationship with the franchise's physics.

Román and Tej's reaction to being in space is worth the price of admission regardless.

- **Stream on**: Peacock

### 13. Fast X (2023)

The son of Fast Five villain Hernan Reyes targets Dom's entire family across multiple continents for revenge. **Fast X** introduces Dante (Jason Momoa) — the franchise's most theatrical, genuinely unhinged villain — and ends on a cliffhanger that sets up the finale.

Jason Momoa is giving a completely different performance to every other actor in the franchise, operating as if he's in a surrealist comedy rather than an action film. He's extraordinary.

- **Stream on**: Peacock
- **Watch for**: Jason Momoa's complete commitment to chaos as Dante

---

## The Upcoming Finale: Fast and Furious 11

**Fast and Furious 11** (also called *Fast X Part 2*) is officially the final chapter of Dom Toretto's story. Confirmed details:

- **Director**: To be confirmed (Louis Leterrier directed Fast X)
- **Release**: Expected 2025–2026
- **Returning cast**: Vin Diesel (Dom), all surviving Fast Family members
- **Plot**: Continuation of Fast X's cliffhanger; resolution of Dante's threat
- **Paul Walker tribute**: Vin Diesel has confirmed Brian O'Conner will appear in some form — through legacy footage and/or a new interpretation
- **Promise**: Return to street racing roots alongside franchise-scale action

The franchise has promised this will be the final Dom Toretto story, though spinoffs may continue.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What order should I watch Fast and Furious for the first time?**
**Release date order** for first-timers — it preserves surprises and character reveals. **Chronological order** (with Tokyo Drift placed after F6) is better for re-watches and makes Han's arc coherent.

**Where should Tokyo Drift go in the order?**
Chronologically, **after Fast & Furious 6** — this is when the events of Tokyo Drift actually take place, and Han's fate connects directly to the mid-credits scene of F6. Watching Tokyo Drift third (release order) is confusing because Han appears alive in films 4–6 afterward.

**Do I need to watch Hobbs & Shaw?**
It's optional for the main story — Hobbs & Shaw is a spinoff that doesn't directly impact the main Dom Toretto storyline. Worth watching for Idris Elba's villain and the Dwayne Johnson/Jason Statham dynamic.

**Can I skip F9?**
You can, but you'll miss important plot points for Fast X — particularly Han's return and Jakob's role. If you're watching the full franchise before the finale, include it.

**Is the franchise really ending?**
Fast and Furious 11 has been confirmed as the final Dom Toretto chapter. Spinoffs (Hobbs, potentially others) may continue. Vin Diesel has been very definitive about this being the conclusion.

**Is Fast X on Netflix?**
No — Fast X (and the entire franchise) is primarily on Peacock, not Netflix. Some earlier films are also free on Tubi.

---

## Conclusion

The Fast & Furious franchise's watch order is actually simple once you understand the Tokyo Drift problem. For first-timers, release date order is easiest. For the full chronological experience, place Tokyo Drift after Fast & Furious 6.

**The must-watch films**:
1. **The Fast and the Furious** — origin
2. **Fast Five** — where it all comes together
3. **Furious 7** — the emotional peak
4. **Fast X** — the current story setup

With Fast and Furious 11 as the franchise finale on the horizon, 2026 is the perfect time for a full rewatch marathon on Peacock.
