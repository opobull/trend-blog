## Match Overview

Inter Milan travel to Stadio Zini on Sunday evening to face Cremonese in Serie A, with a chance to stretch their lead at the top to eight points before rivals AC Milan play on Tuesday.

The Nerazzurri currently sit five points clear at the summit following a dominant 6-2 victory over Pisa last weekend and a 2-0 Champions League win against Borussia Dortmund in midweek.

## Inter Milan's Title Push

Cristian Chivu's side has been imperious in recent weeks:

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| League Position | 1st |
| Points Lead | 5 (over AC Milan) |
| Unbeaten Run | 10 Serie A matches |
| Goals Scored | 50 (3rd best in Europe's top 5 leagues) |
| Away Record | 8 wins, 9 goals conceded |

Inter have won all domestic away fixtures since losing to Napoli in October and boast a perfect record against teams in the bottom half of Serie A, scoring 31 goals while conceding just six.

### Recent Form

Federico Dimarco has been outstanding this season with 12 goal involvements (5 goals, 7 assists) from 20 appearances. His stunning free kick against Dortmund showcased his current form.

Lautaro Martinez has scored 12 league goals and is expected to return to the starting lineup after being rested in midweek.

## Cremonese's Struggles

The hosts are in freefall, having won just three points from their last eight matches:

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| League Position | 13th |
| Points Above Relegation | 6 |
| Home Wins This Season | 2 |
| Goals in Last 8 Games | 2 |
| Goalless Games (Recent) | 7 |

Manager Davide Nicola, usually known as a survival specialist, faces mounting pressure as forward pairing Federico Bonazzoli and Jamie Vardy have both stalled on five goals each.

## Team News

### Inter Milan
**Out:** Denzel Dumfries, Hakan Calhanoglu, Nicolo Barella (injured)

**Returning:** Alessandro Bastoni, Lautaro Martinez (both rested vs Dortmund)

Davide Frattesi could earn a rare start in the absence of Calhanoglu and Barella.

### Cremonese
**Out:** Michele Collocolo, Warren Bondo, Martin Payero (injured); Tommaso Barbieri (suspended)

**New Signings:** Milan Djuric (striker), Youssef Maleh (midfielder from Lecce)

## Head-to-Head

Inter have won all but one of eight previous league visits to Cremonese and beat them 4-1 at San Siro earlier this season.

## What's Next

Inter have a busy schedule ahead:
- **Feb 4:** Coppa Italia quarter-final vs Torino
- **Feb 8:** Sassuolo (A) - Serie A
- **Feb 15:** Juventus (H) - Derby d'Italia
- **Feb 20:** Bodo/Glimt (A) - Champions League playoff

A win here would put significant daylight between Inter and their title rivals before two difficult fixtures against Sassuolo and Juventus.
