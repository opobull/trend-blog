**Cape Fear**, the 10-episode psychological thriller from Apple TV+, will premiere on **June 5, 2026** with its first two episodes. New episodes will drop every Friday through July 31.

The series stars **Amy Adams**, **Javier Bardem**, and **Patrick Wilson** in a modern reimagining of the classic thriller. Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg serve as executive producers, with Nick Antosca (Brand New Cherry Flavor) as creator and showrunner.

![Brilliant Minds NBC](/images/entertainment-am-2026-02-06-1.jpg)

In a significant blow to the Zachary Quinto-led series, **NBC has pulled Brilliant Minds from its schedule** after 14 episodes in Season 2. The remaining six episodes will air at an undetermined date later this season or in the summer.

The move makes room for **The Voice Season 29**, which will run for two hours on Mondays beginning with its February 23 premiere, following the conclusion of the 2026 Winter Olympics.

**Key Information:**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Network | NBC |
| Status | Pulled from schedule |
| Episodes Aired | 14 (Season 2) |
| Remaining | 6 episodes |
| Replacement | The Voice Season 29 |

The medical drama, starring Quinto as neuroscientist Dr. Oliver Wolf, premiered to modest ratings and has struggled to find an audience in its Monday night time slot. The schedule removal casts serious doubt on the show's future renewal prospects.
