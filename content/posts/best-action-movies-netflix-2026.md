## 🔥 The Essential Netflix Action Films

### 1. Godzilla Minus One (2024)

If you see only one action film on this list, make it **Godzilla Minus One**. The Japanese monster epic won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects — and genuinely earned it, doing so on a budget a fraction of Hollywood counterparts.

Set in post-WWII Japan, the film follows a kamikaze pilot who survived the war, wracked with guilt, trying to rebuild his life — only to face Godzilla's terrifying attacks on a broken nation. What makes it exceptional is the humanity: Godzilla is genuinely terrifying here, and the people facing him are desperate and real.

You can watch the original version or *Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color* — a black-and-white cut that's stunning in its own right.

- **Director**: Takashi Yamazaki
- **Runtime**: 125 minutes
- **Best for**: Monster movie fans, anyone who wants action with genuine emotional weight

### 2. RRR (2022)

**RRR** (*Roudram Ranam Rudhiram*) is the most purely entertaining action film of the decade. S.S. Rajamouli's historical epic imagines a fictionalized friendship between two real Indian revolutionaries — Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) — who both fight British colonial rule in 1920s India.

The action sequences are extraordinary: a bridge rescue involving hundreds of animals, a dance-off, a fight against an entire colonial army. But what sets RRR apart is how joyful it is — a film that operates at maximum emotional intensity throughout its three-hour runtime and earns every moment of it.

Won the Oscar for Best Original Song ("Naatu Naatu"). Essential viewing.

- **Director**: S.S. Rajamouli
- **Runtime**: 182 minutes
- **Best for**: Anyone who wants the most kinetically thrilling action experience on Netflix

### 3. Extraction (2020) & Extraction 2 (2023)

Chris Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake, a black-market mercenary who takes a job rescuing the kidnapped son of an Indian drug lord in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The original **Extraction** features one of the most technically impressive action sequences in recent cinema — a 12-minute "oner" (single-take) chase through Dhaka's streets.

**Extraction 2** is even better. Director Sam Hargrave escalates everything: a prison break sequence involving a continuous 21-minute shot is among the most ambitious action filmmaking in Netflix history. Rake's character development across both films is surprisingly effective.

Both are Netflix Originals and both are essential viewing for action fans.

- **Director**: Sam Hargrave
- **Runtime**: 116 min (Extraction), 122 min (Extraction 2)
- **Best for**: Action enthusiasts who appreciate technical craft and choreography

### 4. Electric State (2025)

The Russo Brothers (Avengers: Endgame directors) return with this Netflix Original based on Simon Stålenhag's illustrated novel. Set in an alternate 1990s where a brutal human-robot war has ravaged America, **Millie Bobby Brown** plays an orphaned teenager who discovers a mysterious robot and sets off across the dystopian country with a smuggler (Chris Pratt).

The retrofuturistic 1990s aesthetic is striking, the world-building is rich, and the action sequences showcase the Russos' blockbuster experience. Anthony Mackie, Ke Huy Quan, Jenny Slate, and Woody Harrelson voice robot characters.

- **Directors**: Joe and Anthony Russo
- **Runtime**: ~130 minutes
- **Best for**: Sci-fi action fans, Stranger Things fans who want something bigger

### 5. The Old Guard 2 (2025)

Charlize Theron returns as Andy, the leader of a group of immortal mercenaries who have protected humanity across centuries. **The Old Guard 2** expands the mythology of the first film while raising the personal stakes: a long-lost immortal resurfaces with unclear motives, threatening the group's unity.

Theron remains one of cinema's best action performers (see also: Mad Max: Fury Road, Atomic Blonde), and the fight choreography here is excellent. A sequel that justifies its existence.

- **Runtime**: ~118 minutes
- **Best for**: Fans of the first Old Guard, action films with mythology and character depth

---

## 🌏 International Action Hits

### 6. The Wandering Earth (2019) & The Wandering Earth II (2023)

China's answer to Hollywood disaster epics — and genuinely comparable in scale. The original **The Wandering Earth** imagines humanity mounting massive rocket thrusters on Earth itself to move the planet away from a dying sun, navigating the gravitational perils of Jupiter along the way.

The scale is staggering, the disaster sequences are spectacular, and the film has more emotional sincerity than most comparable Hollywood productions. **The Wandering Earth II** is the prequel and is equally ambitious.

- **Best for**: Sci-fi action fans, disaster movie enthusiasts

### 7. Money Heist (La Casa de Papel) — The Film (2021)

While primarily known as a series, the **Money Heist** universe also includes film tie-ins and a Korean adaptation (*Money Heist: Korea*). If you haven't seen the series itself, all seasons are on Netflix — one of the most-watched non-English language series ever made. The Professor's elaborate heists combine action with chess-match tension.

- **Best for**: Fans of heist films, those who haven't experienced the Money Heist phenomenon yet

### 8. Carter (2022)

South Korean action film that's essentially one extended continuous take — following agent Carter through a North Korea-set action nightmare involving bioterrorism and a missing girl. The "single shot" technique is genuinely dizzying and technically remarkable.

If you like your action maximalist and South Korean, Carter delivers.

- **Director**: Byung-gil Jung
- **Runtime**: 132 minutes
- **Best for**: Korean action fans, technical filmmaking enthusiasts

### 9. The Night Agent (2023) — Series

*The Night Agent* isn't a film but deserves mention as Netflix's most-watched English-language series of 2023. A low-level FBI agent manning a crisis hotline gets pulled into a White House conspiracy when a witness calls in. The action is relentless and the twists keep coming.

Season 2 arrived in 2025. Both seasons are on Netflix.

- **Best for**: Thriller/action series fans

## 💥 Netflix Original Action Films

### 10. The Gray Man (2022)

The Russo Brothers' first Netflix Original — a $200 million globe-trotting spy thriller with **Ryan Gosling** as a CIA mercenary and **Chris Evans** as a sadistic contractor hunting him. The action set pieces span Prague, Bangkok, and beyond.

Evans playing against type as a mustache-twirling villain is worth the price of admission alone.

- **Directors**: Joe and Anthony Russo
- **Runtime**: 122 minutes
- **Best for**: Spy thriller fans, Ryan Gosling fans

### 11. Red Notice (2021)

Netflix's biggest-budget Original at the time of its release. **Dwayne Johnson**, **Ryan Reynolds**, and **Gal Gadot** in a globetrotting heist/chase involving stolen Cleopatra's eggs. It's deliberately light — more comedy than action — but enormous fun as pure entertainment.

The chemistry between Johnson and Reynolds carries the film.

- **Runtime**: 117 minutes
- **Best for**: Light entertainment, fans of any of the three leads

### 12. The Killer (2023)

David Fincher's Netflix Original about a professional hitman (Michael Fassbender) whose cold, methodical philosophy is tested when a job goes wrong. **The Killer** is less conventional action film and more character study — Fassbender narrates throughout with chilling detachment, and the violence when it comes is sudden and unglamorous.

For viewers who want intelligence with their action.

- **Director**: David Fincher
- **Runtime**: 118 minutes
- **Best for**: Thriller fans, David Fincher completionists, those who loved Zodiac or Gone Girl

### 13. Caught Stealing (2025)

Based on Charlie Huston's crime novel, **Caught Stealing** features Austin Butler as a down-on-his-luck bartender in 1990s New York who gets pulled into a deadly conspiracy involving dirty cops, rival gangs, and a mysterious cat. Director Jeremy Saulnier (*Green Room*, *Blue Ruin*) brings his signature unflinching violence and moral ambiguity.

- **Best for**: Noir crime action fans, fans of Saulnier's previous work

### 14. The Gentlemen (2024) — Series

Guy Ritchie's Netflix series is a spiritual successor to his film of the same name. Theo James inherits a country estate and discovers his aristocratic family is entangled with an underground cannabis empire. The action has Ritchie's signature wit, colorful characters, and clockwork plotting.

Eight episodes, endlessly watchable.

- **Best for**: Guy Ritchie fans (Lock Stock, Snatch), English crime drama enthusiasts

## 🎯 Classic & Catalogue Action

### 15. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)

George Miller's masterpiece. An almost wordless, two-hour car chase across a post-apocalyptic desert. **Tom Hardy** and **Charlize Theron** barely speak — they don't need to. Every frame is dense with detail; every action sequence is meticulously designed practical stunt work.

**Won 6 Academy Awards.** One of the greatest action films ever made, and essential viewing.

- **Director**: George Miller
- **Runtime**: 120 minutes
- **Best for**: Everyone

### 16. Sicario (2015)

Denis Villeneuve's cartel thriller is one of the most intense films of the decade. An idealistic FBI agent (Emily Blunt) is recruited into a mysterious task force targeting a Mexican cartel — and gradually realizes the operation is not what she was told. Roger Deakins' cinematography is extraordinary.

*Sicario* operates as both action thriller and moral horror story.

- **Director**: Denis Villeneuve
- **Runtime**: 121 minutes
- **Best for**: Serious thriller fans, fans of Denis Villeneuve (Dune, Blade Runner 2049)

### 17. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)

Ang Lee's wuxia epic remains the gold standard for wire-fu action filmmaking. Two warriors in 19th-century China pursue a stolen sword and become entangled with a headstrong young woman and her secret past. The rooftop and bamboo forest fight sequences are still breathtaking 25 years later.

**Won 4 Academy Awards.** Essential cinema.

- **Director**: Ang Lee
- **Runtime**: 120 minutes
- **Best for**: Martial arts fans, film history enthusiasts

### 18. The Raid: Redemption (2011)

An Indonesian SWAT team infiltrates a Jakarta tower block controlled by a crime lord — and finds every floor manned by armed criminals. **The Raid** is one of the purest action experiences in cinema: a relentless, 100-minute martial arts gauntlet with virtually no downtime.

The fight choreography, featuring the Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat, influenced action filmmaking worldwide. The sequel (*The Raid 2*) is equally essential.

- **Director**: Gareth Evans
- **Runtime**: 101 minutes
- **Best for**: Martial arts fans, action purists

### 19. Heat (1995)

Michael Mann's Los Angeles crime epic pits detective Al Pacino against professional thief Robert De Niro in a three-hour cat-and-mouse. **Heat** features one of the greatest bank robbery/shootout sequences in film history — and the famous coffee shop scene between Pacino and De Niro alone is worth the runtime.

A masterwork that rewards rewatching.

- **Director**: Michael Mann
- **Runtime**: 170 minutes
- **Best for**: Crime thriller fans, anyone who appreciates cinematic craftsmanship

### 20. John Wick (2014)

The film that redefined action choreography for a generation. Keanu Reeves as a retired hitman who comes out of retirement after someone kills his dog. What sounds thin becomes an extraordinary showcase of "gun-fu" combat choreography and meticulous world-building.

All four John Wick films are available on Netflix.

- **Director**: Chad Stahelski
- **Runtime**: 101 minutes (John Wick 1)
- **Best for**: Action fans — essential modern action cinema

---

## 🚀 Sci-Fi Action

### 21. Battleship (2012)

Alien spacecraft land in the Pacific Ocean and a Navy destroyer crew must stop them. **Battleship** is unapologetically big, loud, and dumb — but delivers exactly what it promises. Turn your brain off, enjoy the spectacle.

- **Runtime**: 131 minutes
- **Best for**: Pure entertainment without demands

### 22. Total Recall (1990)

Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi classic with Arnold Schwarzenegger: a man haunted by memories of Mars has those memories removed — only to discover they might be real. Wild action, sharp satire, and practical effects that still impress.

- **Runtime**: 113 minutes
- **Best for**: Sci-fi action fans, Schwarzenegger fans

### 23. Spectral (2016)

A Netflix Original sci-fi military thriller: US special forces in a war zone encounter something they can't explain — translucent, fast-moving entities that kill on contact. They must find a way to fight something that shouldn't exist.

Underrated Netflix sci-fi with solid action sequences.

- **Runtime**: 107 minutes
- **Best for**: Military sci-fi fans

---

## 🎭 Action-Comedy

### 24. Murder Mystery (2019) & Murder Mystery 2 (2023)

- **Best for**: Light comedy-action fans, fans of either lead

### 25. The Do-Over (2016)

Adam Sandler again — a man fakes his own death to escape his dull life and convinces his old friend to do the same. What follows is a series of escalating misadventures. More crime thriller than pure comedy, with some solid action beats.

- **Best for**: Easy entertainment, Sandler fans
