## 🔥 New in 2026: Fresh Hits

### 1. Steal (2026)

The breakout thriller of early 2026. **Sophie Turner** (*Game of Thrones*' Sansa Stark) plays Emma, an entirely unremarkable office worker who gets drawn into a major heist through circumstances she never anticipated — and turns out to be surprisingly good at it.

**Steal** is a propulsive 6-episode run that delivers twist after twist without losing internal logic. Turner sheds every trace of Sansa and commands the screen with a performance that's been drawing comparisons to *Killing Eve*'s Jodie Comer. One of Prime Video's best original thrillers.

- **Episodes**: 6
- **Best for**: Heist thriller fans, Sophie Turner fans, anyone who liked Killing Eve or Bodyguard

### 2. The Night Manager (Season 2, 2026)

One of 2026's most surprising returns. **Tom Hiddleston** reprises Jonathan Pine — now a low-level MI6 officer — as he's drawn into a conspiracy to destabilize a nation. **Hugh Laurie** returns as villain Richard Roper, and the reunion of the two leads ten years after the original is electric.

The original *The Night Manager* (2016) won multiple BAFTAs and Golden Globes; this sequel inherits that pedigree and appears to exceed it. Essential for spy thriller fans.

- **Episodes**: Season 2 currently airing
- **Best for**: Spy drama fans, Hiddleston fans, fans of the original series

### 3. Scarpetta (2026)

**Nicole Kidman** as Dr. Kay Scarpetta — Patricia Cornwell's iconic forensic pathologist who has appeared in 25 novels and becomes the first Scarpetta adaptation for television. When a high-profile murder intersects with her personal life, Scarpetta must navigate both the investigation and the spotlight.

Kidman's involvement guarantees prestige; the source material provides decades of compelling cases to draw from.

- **Best for**: Crime drama fans, Patricia Cornwell readers, Nicole Kidman fans

### 4. Cross (Season 2, 2026)

**Aldis Hodge** returns as Alex Cross — the forensic psychologist/detective created by James Patterson — in the second season of Prime Video's adaptation. Season 2 pits Cross against a ruthless vigilante who believes they're doing the right thing.

Season 1 was a solid thriller launch; Season 2 expands the universe with higher stakes and more complex antagonists.

- **Best for**: Crime thriller fans, James Patterson readers

### 5. 56 Days (2026)

An erotic thriller that's become one of Prime Video's most-discussed new series. **Dove Cameron** and **Avan Jogia** play a couple whose intense 56-day lockdown romance takes a fatal turn. Based on Catherine Ryan Howard's bestselling novel, the series blends romance, psychological tension, and mystery across its run.

- **Best for**: Thriller drama fans, fans of psychological suspense

## ⚡ Action & Superhero Essentials

### 6. Fallout (Seasons 1–2)

The best video game adaptation since *The Last of Us*. Set in an alternate-history America devastated by nuclear war, **Fallout** follows three characters whose paths collide in the irradiated wasteland: a vault dweller (Ella Purnell), a deserter soldier (Aaron Moten), and a ghoul bounty hunter (Walton Goggins).

**Fallout** works for viewers who've never touched the game because it builds its world from scratch with wit, violence, and a retro-futuristic aesthetic that's visually distinctive. For game fans, every environmental detail is a love letter to the source material. Both seasons are now available.

- **Episodes**: 8 per season
- **Best for**: Post-apocalyptic sci-fi fans, Fallout game fans, anyone who liked The Last of Us

### 7. Reacher (Seasons 1–3)

**Alan Ritchson** is Jack Reacher — a massive, drifting former military policeman who has a gift for finding trouble and an extraordinary ability to deal with it. The show deliberately rejects franchise complexity in favor of something simpler: a big man solving problems through intelligence and overwhelming physical force.

In an era of bloated franchise storytelling, Reacher is deliberately refreshing. Each season is a new standalone mystery. Season 3 is currently on Prime Video.

- **Episodes**: 8 per season
- **Best for**: Action fans, thriller fans who don't want homework, anyone who liked the Tom Cruise films but wanted something bigger and simpler

### 8. The Boys (Seasons 1–4)

The most savage superhero satire on television. In a world where superheroes exist and are managed by a corporation (Vought International) like any other celebrity product, **The Boys** follows a group of vigilantes trying to expose the heroes' true, frequently monstrous nature.

**The Boys** is funny, violent, and genuinely incisive about celebrity culture, corporate power, and American politics. Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and Homelander (Antony Starr) are two of the great TV characters of the decade — monsters in different and complementary ways.

The **final season** is coming in 2026, along with prequel spinoff *Vought Rising*.

- **Episodes**: 32 across 4 seasons + spinoffs
- **Best for**: Superhero fans who want deconstruction, adult animation fans, anyone tired of squeaky-clean heroes

### 9. Invincible (Seasons 1–3)

Based on Robert Kirkman's (*The Walking Dead*) comic series, **Invincible** follows teenage superhero Mark Grayson — son of the world's most powerful hero — discovering that his father's legacy is darker than he knew. The animation is exceptional, the story escalates brilliantly, and Season 3 became Prime Video's most-watched animated season ever.

**Season 4 arrives March 2026** — perfect time to catch up.

- **Episodes**: 8 per season (Seasons 1–3 available)
- **Best for**: Superhero fans who want mature, consequence-driven storytelling; animation fans

### 10. Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2024)

A complete reimagining of the spy concept: **Donald Glover** and **Maya Erskine** play two strangers recruited by a mysterious agency and paired as a married couple for undercover spy work — while their professional arrangement slowly becomes something real.

*Mr. & Mrs. Smith* has the domestic intimacy of *The Americans* with Donald Glover's distinctive tonal sensibility — laid-back wit punctuated by sudden, brutal violence. Guest stars (Parker Posey, Wagner Moura, John Turturro) elevate individual episodes.

- **Episodes**: 8
- **Best for**: Spy drama fans, Donald Glover fans, The Americans fans

## 🌍 Prestige Drama

### 11. Fleabag (2016–2019)

**Phoebe Waller-Bridge**'s two-season masterpiece remains the pinnacle of Prime Video's prestige catalog. A young woman navigates grief, guilt, desire, and family dysfunction in London — breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly with devastating honesty.

Season 2 is one of the finest television seasons ever produced. The finale is heartbreaking. Fleabag won 6 Emmy Awards including Outstanding Comedy Series twice.

- **Episodes**: 12 across 2 seasons (~25 min each)
- **Best for**: Everyone — required viewing regardless of taste

### 12. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (Complete Series)

Set in 1950s New York, **Midge Maisel** (Rachel Brosnahan) discovers she has a talent for stand-up comedy after her husband leaves her — and pursues it against the expectations of her world. Amy Sherman-Palladino's creation is the fastest-talking, most meticulously period-detailed comedy-drama on television.

All five seasons are available; the series concluded in 2023 with its best season. 20 Emmy Awards.

- **Episodes**: 50+ across 5 seasons
- **Best for**: Comedy drama fans, fans of 1950s Americana, anyone who wants joyful television

### 13. Good Omens (Seasons 1–3)

**David Tennant** and **Michael Sheen** as a demon and an angel who have spent 6,000 years on Earth and grown rather attached to it — and must work together to stop the apocalypse. Based on Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman's beloved novel, **Good Omens** captures the book's warmth, wit, and philosophical playfulness beautifully.

Season 3 is the final season, currently on Prime Video.

- **Episodes**: Season 3 currently available
- **Best for**: Pratchett and Gaiman fans, fantasy comedy enthusiasts

### 14. Jack Ryan (Seasons 1–4)

**John Krasinski** as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, thrust into the field when he uncovers a pattern suggesting a new terrorist threat. The series ran four seasons — each a different geopolitical threat — with the finale season (Season 4) delivering a satisfying conclusion to the Ryan storyline.

- **Best for**: Spy thriller fans, political drama enthusiasts

## 🐉 Fantasy & Sci-Fi

### 15. The Rings of Power (Seasons 1–2)

Amazon's billion-dollar Middle-earth series covers the Second Age — the forging of the Rings of Power, the rise of Sauron, and the fall of Númenor. Season 2 dramatically improved on the first, with Sauron fully operational and major consequences for characters on multiple fronts.

Essential for Lord of the Rings fans. See our [complete Lord of the Rings watch order guide](/posts/how-to-watch-lord-of-the-rings-in-order-2026/) for how it fits into the full Middle-earth viewing sequence.

### 16. The Expanse (Complete Series, Seasons 1–6)

The most scientifically plausible science fiction series ever made. Set two centuries in the future when humanity has colonized the solar system, **The Expanse** is a political thriller about the tensions between Earth, Mars, and the asteroid belt — until an alien artifact changes everything.

Originally on Syfy (cancelled after Season 3), Prime Video rescued and completed the series. All six seasons represent one of the greatest achievements in TV science fiction.

- **Episodes**: 62 across 6 seasons
- **Best for**: Hard sci-fi fans, political drama enthusiasts, anyone who found other sci-fi too soft on the science

### 17. The Grand Tour (Seasons 1–5)

### 18. Upload (Seasons 1–3)

In a near-future where the dying can upload their consciousness to a digital afterlife, **Nathan** (Robbie Amell) finds himself in a luxury virtual afterlife — with his earth-bound customer service rep/love interest (Andy Allo) as his only real connection. **Upload** is smart comedy with surprising emotional depth.
