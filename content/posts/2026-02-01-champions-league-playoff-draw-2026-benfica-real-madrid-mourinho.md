## What Happened

The UEFA Champions League knockout phase playoff draw took place on January 31, 2026, setting up eight two-legged ties that will determine which teams advance to the round of 16.

The headline matchup: **Jose Mourinho's Benfica will face Real Madrid** — a rematch just three weeks after their dramatic league phase encounter where goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored a 98th-minute header to seal a stunning 4-2 victory for the Portuguese side.

## Key Matchups

### Benfica vs Real Madrid

This is the tie everyone is talking about. Benfica have won three of the clubs' previous four European meetings, including the 1962 European Cup final. Mourinho, who previously managed Real Madrid from 2010-2013, now has another chance to get one over on his former club.

The drama from their January 29 meeting — where Trubin's last-gasp goal clinched Benfica's playoff spot while dropping Madrid out of the top-eight automatic qualifying places — adds extra spice to this fixture.

### Monaco vs Paris Saint-Germain

An all-French clash between Ligue 1 rivals. PSG, the defending champions who finished 11th in the league phase, face Monaco who sit 21 points and nine places below them in domestic competition.

### Newcastle vs Qarabag

Newcastle finished 12th in the league phase and will face Azerbaijani champions Qarabag. The English side will be heavy favorites — Qarabag have not beaten a Premier League team in nine previous attempts and were defeated 6-0 by Liverpool at Anfield in their final league phase outing.
