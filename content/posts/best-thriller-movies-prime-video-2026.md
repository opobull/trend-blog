## Psychological Thrillers on Prime Video

Psychological thrillers are the bread and butter of great cinema — they get inside your head, make you question reality, and leave you thinking for days. Prime Video has some of the best the genre has ever produced.

### 1. Gone Girl (2014)

**IMDb**: 8.1/10 | **Director**: David Fincher | **Starring**: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike

On their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. As the investigation unfolds, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect — but nothing about this case is what it seems.

David Fincher's adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling novel is a razor-sharp dissection of marriage, media manipulation, and the performance of identity. Rosamund Pike delivers one of the most chilling performances in modern cinema, and the twists come fast and hard.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Gone Girl keeps you guessing at every turn. Just when you think you have it figured out, the rug is pulled from under you again. It's the perfect example of a thriller that works on multiple levels — as a mystery, a dark comedy, and a social satire.

---

### 2. Prisoners (2013)

**IMDb**: 8.1/10 | **Director**: Denis Villeneuve | **Starring**: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano

When two young girls go missing on Thanksgiving, their desperate father Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) takes matters into his own hands as Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) investigates the case. As Dover becomes increasingly unhinged, the line between justice and vengeance blurs.

Denis Villeneuve creates an atmosphere of suffocating dread throughout this film's 153-minute runtime. Every scene feels heavy with despair and moral complexity. Hugh Jackman gives one of his finest performances, and the film raises difficult questions about how far a parent would — or should — go to protect their child.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Prisoners is a masterclass in sustained tension. The mystery at its core is genuinely gripping, but what elevates it is the moral ambiguity. There are no easy answers here.

---

### 3. The Machinist (2004)

**IMDb**: 7.7/10 | **Director**: Brad Anderson | **Starring**: Christian Bale, Jennifer Jason Leigh

Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) is an industrial worker who hasn't slept in a year. Gaunt, paranoid, and barely functioning, he begins to suspect that a mysterious coworker is stalking him — but is any of it real?

Christian Bale lost a shocking 63 pounds for this role, and his emaciated frame becomes a visual metaphor for Trevor's psychological deterioration. The film unfolds like a waking nightmare, with clues hidden in plain sight that reward attentive viewers on a second watch.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: If you love psychological thrillers that blur the line between reality and delusion, The Machinist is essential viewing. The final act reveal recontextualizes everything you've watched.

---

### 4. Black Swan (2010)

**IMDb**: 8.0/10 | **Director**: Darren Aronofsky | **Starring**: Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel

Nina (Natalie Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company who wins the coveted lead role in Swan Lake, but the pressure and competition from a new dancer (Mila Kunis) push her toward obsession and madness.

Darren Aronofsky takes the ballet world and turns it into a horrorscape of perfectionism, jealousy, and identity collapse. Natalie Portman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her physically and emotionally demanding performance, and it's completely deserved.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Black Swan works as both a psychological thriller and a horror film. The paranoia builds gradually and relentlessly, and you're never quite sure what's real. It's one of the most viscerally unsettling films of the past two decades.

---

### 5. Get Out (2017)

**IMDb**: 7.7/10 | **Director**: Jordan Peele | **Starring**: Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford

Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) travels with his white girlfriend to meet her parents for the first time. The weekend starts awkwardly and quickly escalates into something far more sinister.

Jordan Peele's directorial debut is a genre-defining film — a sharp social commentary disguised as a supernatural thriller. Every scene is loaded with tension and subtext, and the horror builds from something very real: the experience of being a Black man in predominantly white spaces.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Get Out builds dread masterfully, using social discomfort as the foundation before unleashing something truly terrifying. The third act is an explosive payoff to everything that came before.

---

### 6. Hereditary (2018)

**IMDb**: 7.3/10 | **Director**: Ari Aster | **Starring**: Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro

After the family matriarch passes away, the Graham family begins to unravel, uncovering dark secrets and experiencing increasingly terrifying phenomena.

Ari Aster's debut feature is one of the most acclaimed horror thrillers in recent memory. It's a film that works on you slowly — the real horror isn't in jump scares but in the creeping realization that something deeply wrong has been happening for a very long time. Toni Collette's performance is devastating.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Hereditary is as much a grief drama as it is a thriller. The family dynamics feel devastatingly real, which makes the horror all the more effective. Prepare to be unsettled for days.

---

## Crime Thrillers on Prime Video

Crime thrillers are at their best when they make you feel the moral weight of every decision. These films are grim, atmospheric, and utterly gripping.

### 7. No Country for Old Men (2007)

**IMDb**: 8.2/10 | **Directors**: Joel & Ethan Coen | **Starring**: Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin

When hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong and takes the money, he sets off a chain of events that brings relentless hitman Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) on his trail.

The Coen Brothers' adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel is a near-perfect film. Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is one of cinema's greatest villains — a force of nature with a coin-flip philosophy toward life and death. The film refuses to give audiences the satisfaction they expect, and that makes it all the more powerful.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: The tension in No Country for Old Men is almost physically oppressive. The cattle gun scene, the hotel room confrontation, the gas station coin toss — these are among the most suspenseful sequences ever committed to film.

---

### 8. Sicario (2015)

**IMDb**: 7.6/10 | **Director**: Denis Villeneuve | **Starring**: Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin

Idealistic FBI agent Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is recruited to join a government task force targeting a powerful Mexican drug cartel. As the operation unfolds, she discovers the true — and deeply troubling — nature of the mission.

Denis Villeneuve appears twice on this list for good reason: he's one of the most consistently excellent thriller directors working today. Sicario is a brutal, immersive film that strips away any glamour from the war on drugs. Roger Deakins' cinematography turns the border landscape into something haunting and dangerous.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Sicario puts you in Emily Blunt's shoes — the audience knows exactly as much as she does, which makes every revelation land hard. The tunnel sequence in the third act is one of the most nerve-shredding set pieces in recent cinema.

---

### 9. Zodiac (2007)

**IMDb**: 7.7/10 | **Director**: David Fincher | **Starring**: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo

Based on the true story of the Zodiac Killer, who terrorized San Francisco in the late 1960s and 1970s, the film follows the obsessive investigations of a cartoonist, a journalist, and a detective who each become consumed by the case.

David Fincher treats the Zodiac case with meticulous detail and refuses to invent a tidy resolution. What he creates instead is a film about the psychological toll of an unsolved mystery — how it can consume people for decades. At 157 minutes, Zodiac is patient and methodical, and all the more terrifying for it.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Zodiac is a film about the horror of not knowing. It's one of the few crime thrillers that feels more disturbing as it goes on, even as the action becomes quieter. The basement scene will make your skin crawl.

---

### 10. Heat (1995)

**IMDb**: 8.3/10 | **Director**: Michael Mann | **Starring**: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer

Veteran detective Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) hunts master criminal Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) across Los Angeles in a cat-and-mouse thriller that culminates in one of cinema's greatest shootout sequences.

Michael Mann's sprawling crime epic is over three hours long, but it earns every minute. At its core, Heat is about the mirror-image relationship between cop and criminal — two men defined by their work, unable to exist outside of it. The famous diner scene where Pacino and De Niro share the screen together for the first time is cinema history.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Heat's downtown LA bank robbery shootout is possibly the greatest action-thriller sequence ever filmed, and the film around it is equally rewarding. If you haven't seen it, you're missing one of the all-time greats.

---

### 11. Wind River (2017)

**IMDb**: 7.7/10 | **Director**: Taylor Sheridan | **Starring**: Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Graham Greene

When the frozen body of a young Native American woman is found on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) teams up with a local tracker (Jeremy Renner) to investigate.

Taylor Sheridan (the creator of Yellowstone) wrote and directed this chilling crime thriller that uses the brutal Wyoming landscape as a mirror for the harsh reality faced by Indigenous communities. Wind River is a slow burn that delivers an emotionally devastating payoff.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Wind River gets under your skin in a way few crime thrillers manage. The isolation of the setting, the weight of the subject matter, and a pair of outstanding central performances make this one of the best thrillers of the 2010s.

---

### 12. L.A. Confidential (1997)

**IMDb**: 8.2/10 | **Director**: Curtis Hanson | **Starring**: Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, Kevin Spacey

Three LAPD detectives with very different methods — brute, rule-follower, and celebrity cop — find their paths converging as they investigate a seemingly routine diner massacre that leads to a massive conspiracy.

L.A. Confidential is a perfectly constructed neo-noir crime thriller. Its 1950s Los Angeles setting drips with atmosphere, and the screenplay — adapted from James Ellroy's novel — weaves together multiple storylines into a satisfying, complex whole. It's one of the best-made films of the 1990s.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: The mystery at the heart of L.A. Confidential is genuinely intricate without being impenetrable. As the threads start to connect, you get that rare sensation of a thriller coming together in exactly the right way.

---

## Action Thrillers on Prime Video

Sometimes you want your thriller with more adrenaline — chases, fights, and heroes who hit back. These action thrillers deliver.

### 13. Jack Reacher (2012)

**IMDb**: 7.0/10 | **Director**: Christopher McQuarrie | **Starring**: Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Werner Herzog

When a former sniper is accused of a mass shooting, he requests one person: Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a ghost-like former military investigator with a particular set of skills and no patience for injustice.

The Jack Reacher film adaptation is genuinely excellent genre entertainment. Tom Cruise commits fully to the role, and director Christopher McQuarrie (who would go on to direct multiple Mission: Impossible films) constructs several outstanding action sequences — particularly a memorable car chase through Pittsburgh.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Jack Reacher is smart about its plot while delivering satisfying action. It respects the audience's intelligence while still delivering the thrills. Werner Herzog makes a memorably chilling villain.

---

### 14. Without Remorse (2021)

**IMDb**: 5.7/10 | **Director**: Stefano Sollima | **Starring**: Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell, Jodie Turner-Smith

Navy SEAL John Clark (Michael B. Jordan) seeks vengeance after his pregnant wife is murdered by Russian operatives. His pursuit of justice pulls him into a vast conspiracy that goes all the way to the top.

Based on Tom Clancy's novel, Without Remorse is a pure action thriller that benefits enormously from Michael B. Jordan's screen presence and physicality. The film is leaner and more focused than many Clancy adaptations, and Jordan brings an emotional authenticity to the rage-fueled protagonist.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: If you want an action thriller with genuine emotional stakes and impressive set pieces, Without Remorse delivers. It's a Prime Video original that showcases the platform's investment in big-budget content.

---

### 15. The Terminal List (2022)

**IMDb**: 7.6/10 | **Creators**: David DiGilio | **Starring**: Chris Pratt, Constance Wu, Taylor Kitsch

Navy SEAL James Reece (Chris Pratt) returns home from a mission where his entire platoon was ambushed and killed. As he begins to question his own memory of events, he uncovers a massive conspiracy that will push him beyond all limits.

Available as both a TV series and in condensed form, The Terminal List is among Prime Video's most popular original thrillers. Chris Pratt is excellent in a dramatically demanding role, and the pacing is relentless. It's a gripping watch from start to finish.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: The Terminal List combines military thriller authenticity with conspiracy drama and revenge action in a package that's hard to put down. It's one of the reasons Prime Video has become a serious destination for action-thriller content.

---

### 16. Air Force One (1997)

**IMDb**: 6.6/10 | **Director**: Wolfgang Petersen | **Starring**: Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close

Russian terrorists hijack Air Force One with the US President (Harrison Ford) on board. But the President is no ordinary passenger — he's a decorated veteran who decides to fight back.

Air Force One is pure, uncut 1990s action-thriller gold. It's gleefully over-the-top, Harrison Ford is at his charismatic best, and Gary Oldman plays the terrorist leader with magnificent theatrical menace. "Get off my plane!" remains one of cinema's most satisfying one-liners.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Sometimes you want a thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously and just delivers relentless, enjoyable suspense. Air Force One is exactly that film. It's enormously entertaining and holds up remarkably well.

---

### 17. Enemy of the State (1998)

**IMDb**: 7.3/10 | **Director**: Tony Scott | **Starring**: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight

A lawyer (Will Smith) accidentally receives evidence of a politically motivated murder and suddenly finds himself the target of a rogue NSA official (Jon Voight) with virtually unlimited surveillance resources.

Enemy of the State was eerily prescient about government surveillance long before the Snowden revelations. Tony Scott directs with kinetic energy, and the film benefits from an outstanding supporting cast, particularly Gene Hackman as a paranoid former intelligence operative.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Enemy of the State taps into the primal fear of being watched and hunted by an all-seeing enemy. It's a propulsive, entertaining thriller that also has something genuine to say about the surveillance state.

---

## Mystery and Suspense Thrillers on Prime Video

These films are built around puzzles — who did it, how, and why. The pleasure is in the unraveling.

### 18. Knives Out (2019)

**IMDb**: 7.9/10 | **Director**: Rian Johnson | **Starring**: Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis

When renowned mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead the night of his 85th birthday party, detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is called in to investigate his dysfunctional, wealthy family.

Rian Johnson's love letter to the whodunit genre is an absolute delight. It's funny, sharply observed, and consistently surprising. Daniel Craig having the time of his life with a Southern accent as eccentric detective Blanc is worth the price of admission alone.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Knives Out is the rare thriller that you can enjoy whether you've solved it or not. The screenplay is so inventive that it keeps pivoting and surprising right up to the end. It's one of the most purely enjoyable thrillers of the past decade.

---

### 19. Seven (1995)

**IMDb**: 8.6/10 | **Director**: David Fincher | **Starring**: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow

Two detectives — the rookie Mills (Brad Pitt) and the weary Somerset (Morgan Freeman) — hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his MO in a rain-soaked unnamed city.

David Fincher appears for a third time on this list, which tells you everything you need to know about his mastery of the thriller genre. Seven is a magnificent, disturbing film — one that takes the police procedural and fills it with genuine dread and nihilism. The ending is genuinely shocking even if you've heard about it.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: "What's in the box?" has entered the cultural lexicon for a reason. Seven builds to one of the most memorable, horrifying climaxes in thriller history. The journey there is relentless and brilliant.

---

### 20. The Fugitive (1993)

**IMDb**: 7.8/10 | **Director**: Andrew Davis | **Starring**: Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones

Wrongly convicted of his wife's murder, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) escapes custody and races to find the real killer — while being relentlessly pursued by U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones).

The Fugitive is the gold standard of the wrongly-accused thriller. The cat-and-mouse between Ford and Jones is electric, the pacing is outstanding, and Tommy Lee Jones won a well-deserved Oscar for a performance that is endlessly quotable ("I don't care!"). Thirty years on, it remains supremely entertaining.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: The Fugitive is a masterclass in momentum. It barely stops for breath, but it never sacrifices character development for action. Both leads are at the peak of their powers.

---

### 21. Rear Window (1954)

**IMDb**: 8.5/10 | **Director**: Alfred Hitchcock | **Starring**: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Raymond Burr

Photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg, begins watching his neighbors through his rear window and becomes convinced he has witnessed a murder.

Hitchcock's masterpiece of voyeuristic suspense belongs on every thriller fan's watchlist. The entire film takes place from a single apartment, yet it generates more tension than most action movies. Grace Kelly is luminous, James Stewart is perfectly cast, and the climax is magnificently staged.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Rear Window is the film that essentially defined what a thriller can be. If you haven't seen it, you've been missing the template that hundreds of subsequent films have tried to follow. Check if it's available in your region via Prime Video's classic library.

---

## Sci-Fi Thrillers on Prime Video

Where science fiction meets psychological suspense, you find some of the most intellectually stimulating thrillers in the genre.

### 22. Ex Machina (2014)

**IMDb**: 7.7/10 | **Director**: Alex Garland | **Starring**: Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac

A young programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition to spend a week with his company's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) at a remote estate — and discovers he's been brought to evaluate a humanoid AI (Alicia Vikander). But as the sessions progress, he's no longer sure who is evaluating whom.

Alex Garland's directorial debut is a claustrophobic, deeply unsettling examination of artificial intelligence, consciousness, and manipulation. Alicia Vikander is extraordinary as Ava, and the film's final sequence is as chilling as anything in recent cinema.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Ex Machina operates on multiple levels simultaneously. It's a thriller about AI, but also about power, gender, and the dangers of unchecked genius. Few films will leave you feeling as uneasy about the future.

---

### 23. Annihilation (2018)

**IMDb**: 6.8/10 | **Director**: Alex Garland | **Starring**: Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Oscar Isaac, Tessa Thompson

A biologist (Natalie Portman) signs up for a dangerous secret expedition into Area X, a mysterious zone where the laws of nature don't apply, to find out what happened to her husband — and why the previous expeditions all failed.

Alex Garland's follow-up to Ex Machina is an even more ambitious, stranger film. It's science fiction as nightmare — beautiful and terrifying in equal measure. Based on Jeff VanderMeer's novel, Annihilation resists easy interpretation, which only makes it more fascinating.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Annihilation creates genuine dread from the unknown. It's the kind of film you keep processing for days after you've watched it. The lighthouse sequence is one of the most deeply unsettling things you'll see on screen.

---

### 24. Arrival (2016)

**IMDb**: 7.9/10 | **Director**: Denis Villeneuve | **Starring**: Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker

When alien spacecraft land simultaneously around the world, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is recruited to attempt communication. As she begins to understand the alien language, she realizes it may be changing her perception of time itself.

Denis Villeneuve's third appearance on this list confirms his place as the preeminent director of intelligent, cerebral thrillers. Arrival is emotionally devastating, intellectually stimulating, and formally brilliant. It's one of the best science fiction films of the 21st century.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Arrival builds genuine suspense around the question of what the aliens want — and then delivers a twist that reconfigures everything you've seen. It's a thriller that will break your heart even as it blows your mind.

---

### 25. Minority Report (2002)

**IMDb**: 7.7/10 | **Director**: Steven Spielberg | **Starring**: Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Max von Sydow

In a future where a specialized police unit called PreCrime arrests murderers before they commit their crimes, chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) becomes the quarry when he's accused of a future murder he knows nothing about.

Steven Spielberg directs one of the most visually inventive and intellectually rich thrillers of the 2000s. Minority Report raises profound questions about free will, predestination, and the nature of justice while delivering a relentlessly exciting chase narrative. The production design remains stunning more than two decades on.

**Why thriller fans will love it**: Minority Report combines the paranoia of a wrongly-accused thriller with genuine science fiction ideas and Spielberg's impeccable craft. It's a film that makes you think while it makes your pulse race.
