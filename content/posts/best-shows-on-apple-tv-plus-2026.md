Apple TV+ has pulled off something remarkable: with a fraction of the content library of Netflix or HBO Max, it has consistently produced the most critically acclaimed shows in streaming. In 2026, the service is having its best year yet — *Severance* has officially overtaken *Ted Lasso* as Apple's most-watched series ever, new hits like *Monarch: Legacy of Monsters* Season 2 are arriving weekly, and the overall quality bar remains sky-high.

Whether you're deciding if Apple TV+ is worth the subscription or just need a new binge, this is every show you need to watch right now.

## Why Apple TV+ Stands Out in 2026

Apple TV+ launched in 2019 with a tiny library but a clear philosophy: **quality over quantity**. Five years later, the results speak for themselves. The platform has won multiple Emmy Awards, including Best Drama for *Severance*, Best Comedy for *Ted Lasso*, and a Best Picture Oscar for *CODA*.

At $9.99/month (or free with Apple device purchase), Apple TV+ is the most affordable major streamer — and arguably the one with the highest hit rate per dollar spent. The platform now has over 100 original series and films, with 2026's lineup the most ambitious yet.

## The 15 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right Now

### 1. Severance (Seasons 1–2)
**Genre**: Psychological Thriller / Sci-Fi | **Rating**: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes

*Severance* is the best show on any streaming platform right now. Period. Created by Dan Erickson and directed by Ben Stiller, it follows employees at the mysterious Lumon Industries who have undergone a surgical procedure to completely separate their work and personal memories — they literally become two different people.

Season 2, which arrived in early 2026, has been even more acclaimed than the first. *Severance* has now officially surpassed *Ted Lasso* as Apple TV+'s most-watched series ever. Apple Studios acquired it in a deal worth nearly $70 million and renewed it for Season 3, with Season 4 in talks.

The performances — especially Adam Scott, Patricia Arquette, and Britt Lower — are extraordinary. This is appointment television that will consume your every waking thought.

**Best for**: Anyone who likes mind-bending mysteries, dystopian sci-fi, office satire
**Episodes**: 18 (Seasons 1–2)

---

### 2. Ted Lasso (Seasons 1–3, Season 4 Coming)
**Genre**: Comedy-Drama | **Emmy Awards**: 11

Before *Severance* arrived, *Ted Lasso* was the undisputed king of Apple TV+. Jason Sudeikis plays an optimistic American football coach hired to manage a struggling English soccer team — and has absolutely no idea how soccer works.

What sounds like a silly premise delivered one of the most heartfelt, genuinely warm shows ever made. *Ted Lasso* won the Emmy for Best Comedy three years in a row and helped put Apple TV+ on the map. Season 4 is confirmed for 2026, with Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, Hannah Waddingham, and Juno Temple all returning.

If you've never seen it, start immediately. All three seasons are available now.

**Best for**: Anyone who wants to feel genuinely good about the world
**Episodes**: 34 (Seasons 1–3)

---

### 3. Silo (Seasons 1–2, Seasons 3–4 Confirmed)
**Genre**: Dystopian Sci-Fi | **Rating**: 89% on Rotten Tomatoes

Based on Hugh Howey's bestselling *Wool* novels, *Silo* is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the last remnants of humanity live in a massive underground silo — and are forbidden from knowing anything about the outside world or their true history.

Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who starts pulling on threads that could unravel everything. The show has a *Lost*-like quality of escalating mystery, with genuinely surprising twists and stunning production design. Apple renewed it for four seasons total, making it one of the platform's anchor shows through 2027.

Season 2 concluded in late 2025 with a jaw-dropping finale. Season 3 is in production.

**Best for**: Fans of *Lost*, *The Handmaid's Tale*, or any slow-burn dystopian mystery
**Episodes**: 20 (Seasons 1–2)

---

### 4. Shrinking (Season 1–2, Season 3 Coming)
**Genre**: Comedy-Drama | **Rating**: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes

Created by Bill Lawrence (*Scrubs*, *Ted Lasso*) and starring Jason Segel and Harrison Ford, *Shrinking* follows a grieving therapist who starts breaking all the rules of his profession — telling patients exactly what he thinks, making blunt demands, ignoring traditional boundaries.

Harrison Ford, in his best comedic role in years, plays his gruff veteran therapist mentor. *Shrinking* has the same emotional DNA as *Ted Lasso* — funny, warm, honest about grief — without being the same show. Season 3 is coming in 2026.

**Best for**: Fans of *Ted Lasso* who want more of that vibe
**Episodes**: 22 (Seasons 1–2)

---

### 5. Slow Horses (Seasons 1–4)
**Genre**: Spy Thriller | **Rating**: 98% on Rotten Tomatoes

Starring Gary Oldman as the brilliant but deliberately difficult Jackson Lamb, *Slow Horses* is the best spy thriller on television. Based on Mick Herron's Slough House novels, it follows a group of disgraced MI5 agents who handle the cases no one else wants.

The show is relentlessly tense, darkly funny, and built around one of TV's greatest characters in Lamb — a man who is simultaneously disgusting and oddly heroic. Four seasons are available on Apple TV+, with Season 5 in production. Don't sleep on this one.

**Best for**: Fans of *The Night Manager*, *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy*, or John le Carré
**Episodes**: 24 (Seasons 1–4)

---

### 6. For All Mankind (Seasons 1–4)
**Genre**: Alternate History Sci-Fi | **Rating**: 87% on Rotten Tomatoes

Created by Ronald D. Moore (*Star Trek*, *Battlestar Galactica*), *For All Mankind* imagines an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union beats America to the Moon in 1969 — kicking off an intensified, never-ending space race.

Each season jumps forward roughly a decade, following different characters as humanity pushes further into space. The show is meticulous about scientific accuracy while delivering emotional, character-driven drama. It's one of the most ambitious shows on any platform, and Season 4 — set on Mars — is its best yet.

**Best for**: Hard sci-fi fans, history buffs, anyone who loved *The Martian*
**Episodes**: 40 (Seasons 1–4)

---

### 7. The Morning Show (Seasons 1–3)
**Genre**: Drama | **Rating**: 74% on Rotten Tomatoes

Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon star as co-anchors of a morning news show navigating the aftermath of a #MeToo scandal. Steve Carell plays the disgraced anchor whose removal sets the whole story in motion.

*The Morning Show* is messy, melodramatic, and occasionally overwrought — but that's also why it's so watchable. Season 3 added Jon Hamm to the cast and tackled AI disruption in media. If you liked *The Newsroom*, this is your show.

**Best for**: Fans of prestige drama, workplace politics, and old-fashioned star power
**Episodes**: 30 (Seasons 1–3)

---

### 8. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters — Season 2 (New in 2026)
**Genre**: Sci-Fi Monster Drama | **Premiere**: February 27, 2026

The *Godzilla* universe series returns with Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell, as the fate of both Monarch and the world hangs in the balance. Season 2 reveals buried secrets that reunite heroes and villains on Kong's Skull Island as a new, mysterious Titan rises.

Season 1 was a smart, character-driven take on the MonsterVerse that proved the franchise could work as prestige TV. Season 2 promises to be even bigger in scope.

**Best for**: Fans of *Godzilla*, *Kong: Skull Island*, or monster movies in general
**Premiere**: February 27, 2026

---

### 9. The Last Thing He Told Me — Season 2 (New in 2026)
**Genre**: Thriller Drama | **Premiere**: February 20, 2026

Jennifer Garner returns as Hannah, whose husband Owen (now played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, replacing Nikolaj Coster-Waldau... wait, he was always in the show) reappears after five years on the run. Hannah and her stepdaughter Bailey race to reunite their family before the past catches up with them.

Season 1 was a gripping thriller based on Laura Dave's bestselling novel. Season 2 is an original story that continues the characters' journey. With Judy Greer and Rita Wilson joining the cast, it's shaping up to be a strong early 2026 watch.

**Best for**: Fans of thriller novels, procedural dramas, Jennifer Garner
**Premiere**: February 20, 2026

---

### 10. Disclaimer (Limited Series)
**Genre**: Psychological Thriller | **Rating**: 80% on Rotten Tomatoes

Alfonso Cuarón (*Gravity*, *Children of Men*) directed this limited series starring Cate Blanchett as Catherine Ravenscroft, a celebrated journalist whose life unravels when a mysterious novel appears revealing secrets from her past. Kevin Kline plays the author with a disturbing obsession.

*Disclaimer* is visually stunning and narratively unnerving — exactly what you'd expect from Cuarón. Blanchett is predictably magnificent. At 7 episodes, it's a tight, unsettling watch.

**Best for**: Fans of psychological thrillers, prestige limited series, Cate Blanchett
**Episodes**: 7

---

### 11. Foundation (Seasons 1–2)
**Genre**: Epic Sci-Fi | **Rating**: 69% on Rotten Tomatoes

Based on Isaac Asimov's seminal novels, *Foundation* is the most visually ambitious sci-fi series ever made — Apple reportedly spent over $40 million per season on production. It follows mathematician Hari Seldon's prediction that the Galactic Empire will fall, and his plan to preserve civilization.

The show took time to find its footing but Season 2 was a massive improvement, earning genuine praise from even the most skeptical Asimov fans. A Season 3 is in development.

**Best for**: Epic space opera fans, Asimov readers, fans of *Dune*
**Episodes**: 20 (Seasons 1–2)

---

### 12. Bad Sisters (Seasons 1–2)
**Genre**: Dark Comedy-Drama | **Rating**: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes

One of the best shows of 2022 and still criminally underrated. *Bad Sisters* follows four Irish sisters who plot to kill their abusive brother-in-law — and we know from the start that they succeed. The show cleverly toggles between past (the murder plot) and present (an insurance investigation).

Created by Sharon Horgan, who also stars, it's funny, dark, incredibly moving, and sharply written. Season 2 expanded the universe with a new murder plot. Absolutely unmissable.

**Best for**: Fans of dark comedy, British/Irish TV, female-led ensembles
**Episodes**: 18 (Seasons 1–2)

---

### 13. Presumed Innocent (Limited Series)
**Genre**: Legal Thriller | **Rating**: 87% on Rotten Tomatoes

Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Rusty Sabich, a prosecutor accused of murdering his colleague (and secret lover). Based on Scott Turow's classic legal thriller novel (previously adapted as a 1990 Harrison Ford film), this 8-episode limited series ratchets up tension episode by episode.

The show works both as a whodunit and as a portrait of a marriage under catastrophic pressure. Ruth Negga and Bill Camp are exceptional in supporting roles.

**Best for**: Legal thriller fans, fans of *Big Little Lies* or *The Undoing*
**Episodes**: 8

---

### 14. Pachinko (Seasons 1–2)
**Genre**: Historical Drama | **Rating**: 98% on Rotten Tomatoes

Possibly the most beautiful show Apple has ever made. *Pachinko* spans four generations of a Korean family, from Japanese-occupied Korea in 1910 to modern-day Tokyo, weaving together timelines with breathtaking cinematography and devastating emotional power.

Based on Min Jin Lee's beloved novel, *Pachinko* is primarily in Korean and Japanese with subtitles — don't let that deter you. Season 2 arrived in 2024 and maintained the extraordinary standard of the first.

**Best for**: Fans of sweeping historical drama, Korean cinema, *Parasite*, *Squid Game*
**Episodes**: 16 (Seasons 1–2)

---

### 15. The Studio (New in 2026)
**Genre**: Comedy | **Rating**: 99% on Rotten Tomatoes

*The Studio* is Apple TV+'s breakout comedy hit of 2026. Seth Rogen plays the new head of a fictional movie studio navigating the chaos of Hollywood, with a rotating cast of celebrity cameos every episode. Created by Rogen and Evan Goldberg, it's sharp, self-aware, and genuinely funny.

Critics are calling it the best comedy since *The Bear* Season 1. If you haven't started it yet, this is your sign.

**Best for**: Hollywood insiders, comedy fans, anyone who's seen a movie
**Episodes**: 10 (Season 1)

## Is Apple TV+ Worth It in 2026?

**Yes** — and it's arguably the best value in streaming right now.

At $9.99/month, Apple TV+ costs less than Netflix's Standard plan ($15.49/month) or Max ($15.99/month), yet consistently produces higher-rated content. The platform doesn't have a massive library, but nearly everything it releases is worth watching.

The key question is whether you need quantity or quality. If you're a casual viewer who wants endless options, Netflix is probably right for you. If you'd rather have 15 excellent shows than 500 mediocre ones, Apple TV+ delivers.
