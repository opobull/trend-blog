## Pharrell Honored at Pre-Grammy Event

Pharrell Williams received the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the Recording Academy's Black Music Collective event on Thursday night in Los Angeles. The ceremony, held just days before the 2026 Grammy Awards, celebrated artists whose influence extends beyond music.

The 13-time Grammy winner used the stage to deliver a message about immigration in the United States.

## A Prayer for U.S. Leaders

In his acceptance remarks, Williams called on American leaders to show compassion toward immigrants.

> "I want to pray for the leaders of this nation and the powers that be. I'm praying that they find it in their hearts some empathy, some grace and, most importantly, some mercy for these people who may not have been born in this country, but love it just as much."

His comments drew applause from the audience at the Fairmont Century Plaza ballroom.

> "Trust me, they would not be here if they didn't believe us when we keep saying that this is the greatest nation on the planet. So please—empathy, grace and mercy."

## Justin Timberlake Presents the Award

Justin Timberlake presented Williams with the award after performing a medley of songs they created together, including "Rock Your Body" and "Happy."

"You are one of one," Timberlake said. "You are one of my favorite humans, bro. I am so honored to be here."

## Tyler, the Creator's Emotional Tribute

Tyler, the Creator delivered one of the night's most emotional tributes, crediting Williams with opening doors throughout his career.

> "Every door he goes in, he comes back out, grabs people, gives them the key. You have been, you are and you will always be my North Star."

Dr. Dre, for whom the award is named, highlighted Williams' impact across music, fashion, philanthropy, and entrepreneurship.

"For this, I am so proud to have my name on an award now shared by him," Dr. Dre said.

## Other Honorees

The event also honored two other artists with the Black Music Icon Award:

| Honoree | Award | Notable Performances |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Pharrell Williams | Dr. Dre Global Impact Award | Presented by Justin Timberlake |
| Brandy | Black Music Icon Award | Tributes by Coco Jones, FLO, Kehlani |
| Kirk Franklin | Black Music Icon Award | Tributes by John Legend, Lecrae, PJ Morton |

Brandy, the R&B mainstay, performed "Almost Doesn't Count" and said: "Never did I imagine my name and the word 'icon' to ever merge. I'm humbly just a vessel chosen to use the gift to inspire, touch and change a life."

Kirk Franklin, the 20-time Grammy winner, reflected on his journey from homelessness to gospel stardom: "I learned early on about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and never wanted to be afraid to say that name."

## Eve Receives Overdue Grammy

In a surprise moment, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. presented Eve with a long-overdue Grammy for her contribution to The Roots' 2000 hit "You Got Me." Though Eve rapped on the song, she wasn't credited when the track won best rap performance by a duo or group over two decades ago.

An emotional Eve accepted the award to a standing ovation: "This is actually for little Eve from Philly. What is yours never can miss you."

## What Williams Said About Music

In his acceptance speech, Williams described music as "the skeleton key" that unlocked opportunity throughout his life.

> "A good skeleton key opens all doors, not just exclusive ones. Music opened the doors to the things that matter the most in my life."
