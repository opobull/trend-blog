## 🔥 New & Trending Comedies in 2026

### 1. Back in Action (2025)

Netflix's biggest comedy hit of early 2025. **Cameron Diaz** and **Jamie Foxx** play a married couple who left the spy life behind to raise their kids in the suburbs — only to be dragged back into international espionage when their cover is blown.

The premise sounds familiar, but the execution is sharp: Diaz and Foxx have genuine chemistry, the action sequences are inventive, and the family-spy-life collision generates reliable laughs. One of Netflix's most-watched originals in its first month.

- **Starring**: Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Glenn Close
- **Runtime**: ~114 minutes
- **Best for**: Date nights, action-comedy fans

### 2. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024)

Eddie Murphy's triumphant return as Detroit detective Axel Foley after nearly 30 years. When a new case brings him to Beverly Hills, Axel reunites with old friends (Judge Reinhold, John Ashton) and meets his estranged daughter (Taylour Paige) for the first time in years.

**Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F** exceeded expectations significantly — Murphy is as sharp as ever, and the film strikes the right balance between nostalgia and fresh comedy. One of Netflix's most-watched films of 2024.

- **Starring**: Eddie Murphy, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Taylour Paige, Judge Reinhold
- **Runtime**: 115 minutes
- **Best for**: Eddie Murphy fans, 80s action-comedy nostalgia

### 3. Kneecap (2024)

One of the most surprising comedies of 2024. **Kneecap** follows two Belfast no-gooders (Naoise and Liam Óg) who recruit a teacher to help them launch an Irish-language hip-hop group — and accidentally become the face of a cultural movement.

Shot in Irish (with subtitles), energetically directed, and absolutely fearless in its humor and politics. This is the rare film that feels completely alive — full of music, chaos, and genuine heart. **100% on Rotten Tomatoes** from critics.

- **Starring**: Naoise Ó Cairealláin, Liam Óg Ó Hannaidh, JJ Ó Dochartaigh
- **Runtime**: 105 minutes
- **Best for**: Music fans, those who like comedy with a political edge, anyone bored of predictable films

## 😂 Absurdist & Cult Comedies

### 4. Between Two Ferns: The Movie (2019)

Zach Galifianakis expands his cult web series — where he interviews celebrities in the most deliberately awkward fashion possible — into a full narrative film. Forced to produce 10 celebrity interviews for his employer, he travels the country conducting excruciatingly uncomfortable sit-downs with Benedict Cumberbatch, Brie Larson, Paul Rudd, Keanu Reeves, and many more.

**Between Two Ferns** is exactly the right length for its premise and commits fully to the bit. Galifianakis' deadpan hostility toward his famous guests never gets old.

- **Runtime**: 82 minutes
- **Best for**: Cringe comedy fans, people who watched the web series, everyone who finds awkward silence funny

### 5. Best in Show (2000)

Christopher Guest's masterpiece of improvised mockumentary comedy. A disparate group of dog owners converge on the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia, each competing with pathological intensity.

The ensemble — Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, Bob Balaban — is operating at the highest level of comedic craft. Fred Willard's color commentary is some of the funniest work in film history. **Best in Show** rewards multiple rewatches; you notice new jokes every time.

- **Runtime**: 90 minutes
- **Best for**: Comedy connoisseurs, fans of improvised performance, dog owners

### 6. This Is Spinal Tap (1984)

The original mockumentary. Rob Reiner follows the fictional British heavy metal band Spinal Tap on their disastrous American comeback tour. The jokes are as funny now as they were in 1984 — the tiny Stonehenge, the amplifier that "goes to 11," the rotating members who die in "bizarre gardening accidents."

**This Is Spinal Tap** invented a genre that Christopher Guest, The Office, and countless others built careers on.

- **Runtime**: 82 minutes
- **Best for**: Music fans, comedy history enthusiasts, anyone who hasn't seen the most influential comedy film of the past 40 years

### 7. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)

Wes Anderson's mystery-comedy-adventure set in a fictional European republic between the wars. A legendary concierge (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy Zero Moustafa become entangled in a murder, a stolen painting, and a vast inheritance dispute.

**The Grand Budapest Hotel** is meticulously crafted comedy — every frame composed like a painting, every line delivered with precise comic timing. Fiennes has never been funnier. **Won 4 Academy Awards.**

- **Starring**: Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Tilda Swinton, Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham
- **Runtime**: 100 minutes
- **Best for**: Fans of precise, visual comedy; Wes Anderson enthusiasts

## 🎭 Romantic Comedies

### 8. Set It Up (2018)

Two overworked assistants scheme to get their bosses to fall in love with each other — freeing up their own evenings. **Set It Up** is the most charming Netflix Original rom-com: funny, warm, and featuring excellent chemistry between Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell (before *Anyone But You* made them stars).

- **Starring**: Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Lucy Liu, Taye Diggs
- **Runtime**: 105 minutes
- **Best for**: Romantic comedy fans, anyone who likes smart-funny over broad-funny

### 9. Someone Great (2019)

After a devastating breakup, Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) goes on one last New York City adventure with her two best friends before she moves across the country for her dream job. **Someone Great** is the rare rom-com that's actually about female friendship as much as romance — funny, real, and genuinely moving.

- **Starring**: Gina Rodriguez, DeWanda Wise, Brittany Snow
- **Runtime**: 92 minutes
- **Best for**: Women in their 20s-30s, friendship comedy fans

### 10. Holidate (2020)

Two strangers agree to be each other's plus-ones ("holidates") for every holiday to avoid pressure from their families. **Holidate** is exactly what it promises — light, breezy, and romantic. Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey are charming together.

- **Starring**: Emma Roberts, Luke Bracey
- **Runtime**: 104 minutes
- **Best for**: Easy romantic comedy viewing, holiday seasons

### 11. Always Be My Maybe (2019)

Childhood sweethearts Sasha and Marcus haven't spoken in 15 years — until they reconnect as adults with very different lives. Ali Wong and Randall Park star and co-wrote the script, making the comedy feel specific and real. Keanu Reeves appears playing a hilariously pretentious version of himself.

- **Starring**: Ali Wong, Randall Park, Keanu Reeves
- **Runtime**: 101 minutes
- **Best for**: Romantic comedy fans, Keanu Reeves fans (his cameo is extraordinary)

## 🔫 Action-Comedy

### 12. The Out-Laws (2023)

Adam Devine plays a mild-mannered bank manager who suspects his future in-laws (Pierce Brosnan, Ellen Barkin) are the infamous "Out-Laws" bank robbers. The situational comedy of keeping up appearances with murderous criminal in-laws is mined effectively, and the action sequences are more polished than you'd expect.

- **Starring**: Adam Devine, Pierce Brosnan, Ellen Barkin
- **Runtime**: 95 minutes
- **Best for**: Light action-comedy viewing, group watches

### 13. Murder Mystery (2019) & Murder Mystery 2 (2023)

**Murder Mystery 2** became one of Netflix's most-watched films in its debut weekend. Sometimes that's exactly what you need.

- **Starring**: Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston
- **Runtime**: ~96 minutes each
- **Best for**: Easy entertainment, Sandler-Aniston fan group watches

### 14. The Nice Guys (2016)

1970s Los Angeles. A bumbling private detective (Ryan Gosling) and a hired enforcer (Russell Crowe) form an unlikely partnership to find a missing girl connected to the death of a porn star. **The Nice Guys** is one of the most underappreciated comedy-thrillers of recent years — the Gosling-Crowe dynamic is extraordinary, the period detail is perfect, and the comedy is consistently sharp.

- **Director**: Shane Black
- **Starring**: Ryan Gosling, Russell Crowe
- **Runtime**: 116 minutes
- **Best for**: Anyone who likes their comedy with craft and character

### 15. Game Night (2018)

A group of friends' regular game night takes a surreal turn when a murder mystery game becomes real. **Game Night** is relentlessly inventive — the cinematography mimics board game photography (objects shot to look miniature), and the escalating confusion between game and reality generates sustained comic momentum.

- **Starring**: Jason Bateman, Rachel McAdams, Kyle Chandler
- **Runtime**: 100 minutes
- **Best for**: Game enthusiasts, group movie nights, people who like comedies with a genuine concept

## 😈 Dark Comedy

### 16. The Menu (2022)

A couple travels to a remote island to experience a world-class restaurant run by a visionary chef (Ralph Fiennes). The increasingly elaborate courses take a disturbing turn. **The Menu** straddles dark comedy and horror thriller — a pointed satire of culinary culture, wealth, and the performance of taste.

Anya Taylor-Joy and Fiennes are both exceptional. One of the most original films of 2022.

- **Starring**: Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis
- **Runtime**: 130 minutes
- **Best for**: Mystery fans, people who like comedy with actual plot craft

### 18. Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)

Benoit Blanc is invited to a private island by a tech billionaire (Edward Norton) for a murder mystery party — then a real murder happens. **Glass Onion** is even funnier than the original, with a more overtly satirical edge targeting Silicon Valley hubris. An ensemble including Janelle Monáe, Kate Hudson, and Dave Bautista keeps the energy high throughout.

- **Starring**: Daniel Craig, Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe, Kate Hudson
- **Runtime**: 139 minutes
- **Best for**: Fans of Knives Out (watch first), satirical comedy fans
