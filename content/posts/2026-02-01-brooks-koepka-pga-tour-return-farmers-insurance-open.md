## What Happened

Brooks Koepka made his long-awaited return to the PGA Tour at the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego, California. The five-time major champion became the first star player to return from LIV Golf, making the cut on the number in his first PGA Tour event since 2022.

Koepka was reinstated in surprisingly quick fashion after receiving his release from LIV Golf on December 23, 2025.

## Key Details

### Why He Returned

Koepka cited his family situation as a primary factor in his decision to return to the PGA Tour. He also credited Tiger Woods for helping convince him to work primarily stateside again. The golfer admitted to being nervous earlier in the week but has calmed down entering the weekend rounds.

### Current Tournament Standings

While Koepka made the cut, he is not in contention for the title. Justin Rose holds pole position on the leaderboard, setting a new 36-hole record at Torrey Pines. The 45-year-old Englishman enters Saturday's third round with a four-shot lead.

### Top 5 Leaderboard

|----------|--------|
| 1st | Justin Rose (4-shot lead) |

## What's Next

Justin Rose, the 2025 Masters runner-up, is seeking his 13th PGA Tour win and second in as many years after claiming the St. Jude Championship last August.
