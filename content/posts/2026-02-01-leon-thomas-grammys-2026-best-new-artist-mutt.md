## From Nickelodeon to Grammy Stage

Leon Thomas, a name that might ring a bell for Nickelodeon fans who grew up watching "Victorious," is having his biggest moment yet at the 2026 Grammy Awards. The 32-year-old Brooklyn native has earned six Grammy nominations this year, making him the second-most nominated artist behind only Kendrick Lamar's nine.

Thomas will take the stage at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on February 2nd, not just as a nominee but also as a performer.

## Six Grammy Nominations

Thomas received nominations in the following categories:

| Category | Nominated Work |
|----------|---------------|
| Album of the Year | MUTT |
| Best New Artist | — |
| Best R&B Album | MUTT |
| Best R&B Song | "YES IT IS" |
| Best R&B Performance | "MUTT (Live From NPR's Tiny Desk)" |
| Best Traditional R&B Performance | "VIBES DON'T LIE" |

The "Best New Artist" nomination is particularly notable since Thomas already won a Grammy in 2024 for co-writing SZA's hit single "Snooze," which took home Best R&B Song. This makes him a rare case of a previous Grammy winner being nominated for Best New Artist.

## The Road to Breakthrough

Thomas's journey to the Grammys spans over two decades in entertainment:

### Early Career
- **Age 10:** Played Young Simba in "The Lion King" on Broadway
- **Age 13:** Began voicing Tyrone in "The Backyardigans"
- **2010-2013:** Starred as Andre Harris in "Victorious" alongside Ariana Grande

### Songwriting Success

While building his solo career, Thomas wrote and produced hits for major artists:

- "Snooze" — SZA (No. 1 hit)
- "Nasty" — Ariana Grande
- "Pipe Down" — Drake
- "Love All" — Drake ft. JAY-Z
- "Poison" — Jack Harlow ft. Lil Wayne

He also worked with Post Malone, Kehlani, Ty Dolla $ign, and Bryson Tiller.

## The MUTT Era

Thomas's breakthrough came with his 2024 single "MUTT," a deeply personal track inspired by a breakup and the dog he received from his ex-partner. In an interview with RatedRnB, Thomas explained: "Even though my dog may sometimes make a mess in the house or bark loudly at the neighbors, I know he means well. This became a metaphor for not being a perfect partner but having good intentions."

### MUTT by the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Streams | 492+ million |
| Billboard Hot 100 Peak | #6 |
| Remix | Featuring Chris Brown |

The album "MUTT," described by Grammy.com as "a fusion of jazz, neo-soul, and rock," showcases Thomas's range as a multi-instrumentalist and his influences from D'Angelo to Jimi Hendrix.

## From Collaborator to Star

"Writing these records and working with these big artists is such a blessing, but I want to hit stages and see the world through my music," Thomas said in a 2024 Grammy interview. "This is me putting my music and my dreams first."

After years of working behind the scenes, Thomas's multiple nominations signal his arrival as a solo artist. Being nominated in the same categories as artists he's written for confirms he's no longer just their collaborator—he's their peer.
