Team Jade has launched Season Morphosis for Delta Force on February 3, 2026, introducing a mode that flips the extraction shooter formula on its head. The new Fiery Owl Hunt lets players become the boss instead of hunting one.

## Play as Boss Saeed

The headline feature of Morphosis is Fiery Owl Hunt mode. Players can now control Saeed, a warlord boss character who normally terrorizes operators in the game's extraction mode Operations.

When playing as Saeed, players wield his signature Fire Bow and gain an enhanced Tactical Roll ability far more agile than standard operators. The mode allows squad play—friends can join as Saeed's elite guards, forming a "Boss Squad" that recreates the authentic squad-based threat.

A unique mechanic makes the experience stand out: AI Ahsarah Guards on the map no longer attack player-controlled Saeed squads. Instead, they become allies who provide intel on hostile player locations.

## How It Changes the Game

Introducing a human-controlled boss creates unpredictable match dynamics. AI boss behavior follows patterns players can learn. Real players do not.

"Saeed acts like a moving hot zone on the map," explained Level Designer Seth in an interview with Xbox Wire. Combat-focused players seeking high-risk, high-reward encounters gravitate toward Saeed for exclusive loot drops.

This creates an ecosystem effect. While aggressive squads hunt the boss, stealth-focused players—sometimes called "rat players"—gain safer windows to loot elsewhere on the map.

## Requirements and Rewards

To unlock Saeed, players must complete prerequisite missions called "Saeed's Book" at Operations Level 33. The mode has its own progression system with exclusive rewards:

| Reward | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Executioner | Upgradeable exclusive melee weapon |
| Fiery Owl Helmet | Level 5 protection, craftable at Tyrant rank |
| Fiery Owl Ballistic Vest | Level 5 protection, craftable at Tyrant rank |
| Cosmetics | Exclusive avatars, sprays, and calling cards |

Each Fiery Owl entry consumes one Fiery Owl File, purchasable from the Supply Station for 250,000 Tekniq Alloys, limited to 10 per week.

## New Operator: Vlinder

Support operator Vlinder joins the roster with healing-focused abilities:

- **Med Drones**: Deploy medical UAVs that track and heal squadmates with medical dust
- **Flutter Rescue UAVs**: Automatically dispatch to nearby allies for plasma injection and cardiac defibrillation
- **Windmill Smoke Grenade**: Gesture-controlled smoke grenade for tactical cover

Vlinder is available free through the Season Pass tier.

## New Warfare Map: Aftershock

For players preferring large-scale 32v32 battles, Aftershock delivers urban warfare with full-scene destruction. Players can level buildings and trigger seismic events, fundamentally changing the battlefield during matches.

## Space City Expansion

The Operations map Space City receives substantial additions:

- New Dock area with additional bridge routes
- Water areas now accessible with swimming mechanics
- New boss: Efficiency Director Alonso Hudson
- CEO Office structure optimization
- Buoyancy Lab water level control system
- Macro Sharks that hunt players carrying the "Wound" debuff

## Quality of Life Improvements

Morphosis also addresses player-requested features:

- Solo-queue matchmaking for Layali Grove
- In-game vehicle customization
- Normal difficulty for Tide Prison raid

## Game Performance

Delta Force achieved "Platinum" status in Steam's Best of 2025 awards. The free-to-play tactical shooter currently ranks in Steam's top 25 most played games and top 50 top sellers.

The timing of Fiery Owl Hunt is notable. Escape From Tarkov has been developing similar "play as boss" functionality for its upcoming Scav Life DLC. Delta Force delivered the concept to players first.

Delta Force is available free on PC (Steam), Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. Season Morphosis and all new content are live now.
