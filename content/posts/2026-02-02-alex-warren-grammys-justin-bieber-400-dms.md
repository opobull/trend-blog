## What Happened

Alex Warren, a Best New Artist nominee at the 2026 Grammy Awards, revealed on the red carpet that he had been a devoted Justin Bieber fan growing up—so devoted that he sent approximately 400 direct messages to the pop star.

The 25-year-old singer admitted he had to delete all the evidence once he became famous himself, joking that "there's probably a restraining order" he doesn't know about.

## The Full Story

Speaking to PEOPLE and Entertainment Weekly on the Grammy red carpet on Sunday, February 1, Warren explained that he used to email and DM Bieber as a teenager because they shared a common interest.

"I saw he would skateboard. I was a competitive skateboarder growing up, and so I'd be like, 'We should skate sometime,' thinking he would read it," Warren said.

When asked what celebrity he most wanted to meet at the ceremony, Warren didn't hesitate: "Justin Bieber. That's a simple, easy answer."

### Deleting the Evidence

Warren revealed that he had to scramble to hide his fanboy history once his music career took off.

"I had to delete all of my DMs the minute this all happened," he said. "There were like 400 of 'em. There's probably a restraining order. I don't know."

### Tables Away at the Grammys

The irony is not lost on Warren that he and Bieber are now peers in the music industry. At the 2026 Grammys, they were seated just two tables apart.

"We're like two tables away too," Warren noted, clearly excited about the proximity to his childhood idol.

## A People Person

Warren previously revealed that after learning of his Grammy nomination, he personally reached out to all his fellow Best New Artist nominees.

"I FaceTimed everyone, like literally every Best New Artist," Warren told E! News. "I had an amazing conversation with Sombr and Addison."

He explained his approach: "I love how everyone's art, like, if you look at the best new artists, all of us are different, and I love that so much. And I know I was s----ing myself, so I wanted to make sure everyone else was good."

## Background

Warren rose to fame initially as a member of the Hype House content creation collective before transitioning to a music career. His debut album "You'll Be Alright, Kid" earned him the Best New Artist nomination.

The album includes deeply personal tracks about his late parents, with Warren describing his song "First Time on Earth" as particularly cathartic.

"I remember when we finished that song, I bawled my eyes out," he previously told PEOPLE. "It's something really beautiful where I never got any closure with my parents before they passed."
