## Beyoncé Skips 2026 Grammys

Beyoncé is not attending the 2026 Grammy Awards. The superstar, who dominated last year's ceremony with her historic Album of the Year win for *Cowboy Carter*, is notably absent from this year's event.

The reason is straightforward: Beyoncé did not release any new music during the eligibility period for the 2026 awards.

## No New Releases, No Nominations

The Grammy eligibility period typically runs from mid-September of one year to mid-September of the next. Without any new music released during this window, Beyoncé has no nominations at this year's ceremony.

She is also not scheduled to present or perform at the event.

## Last Year's Historic Win

At the 2025 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé finally won Album of the Year—a category that had eluded her despite numerous nominations throughout her career.

In her acceptance speech, she said:

> "I just feel very full and very honored. It's been many, many years. I want to dedicate this to Ms. Linda Martell [the first commercially successful Black female country artist], and I hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors."

Backstage, she told Entertainment Tonight: "It's very surreal. It's been 25 years of just working really hard and trying my best to keep growing, keep opening up doors. I'm happy that my daughter [Blue Ivy] got to see that."

## Act III Speculation Continues

Despite her absence from the Grammys, speculation about Beyoncé's next project continues. In the days before the ceremony, her Valentine's Day collection sparked rumors about Act III of her *Renaissance* trilogy.

The description for a choker on her website—"a little rock 'n' roll with a whole lotta sexy"—led fans to speculate about a rock-influenced direction for the next album.

## Why She Avoids Red Carpets

In an October 2024 interview with *GQ*, Beyoncé explained her approach to public appearances:

> "I focus on evolution, innovation, and shifting perception. It is fame that can at times feel like prison. So when you don't see me on red carpets, and when I disappear until I have art to share, that's why."

She also discussed her genre-defying approach: "I believe genres are traps that box us in and separate us. Black artists, and other artists of color, have been creating and mastering multiple genres, since forever."

## What's Next

Beyoncé has not announced a timeline for Act III of her *Renaissance* trilogy. The first two acts—*Renaissance* (dance) and *Cowboy Carter* (country)—explored different genres, and fans are eagerly awaiting what direction the third installment will take.
