## The 25 Best Anime on Netflix (2026)

### 🔥 Action & Shonen

#### 1. Jujutsu Kaisen (Seasons 1–2)

If you can only watch one anime on this list, make it **Jujutsu Kaisen**. This supernatural action series follows **Yuji Itadori**, a high school student who swallows a cursed finger belonging to the legendary demon Ryomen Sukuna — and becomes his host.

What follows is one of the most thrilling rides in modern anime. The animation quality is genuinely jaw-dropping, the fight choreography is some of the best ever put to screen, and the characters are instantly lovable. Season 2 raised the stakes even higher with the Shibuya Incident arc — a sequence of events that anime fans are still talking about.

- **Genre**: Supernatural action, shonen
- **Episodes**: 47+ across two seasons
- **Best for**: Action fans, fans of My Hero Academia or Naruto

#### 2. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba

**Demon Slayer** is a visual masterpiece. Studio Ufotable's animation — all fluid motion, water-like sword strikes, and vivid color — makes even the quiet moments beautiful. The story follows **Tanjiro Kamado**, a boy who becomes a Demon Slayer after his family is slaughtered and his sister transformed into a demon.

All four seasons are on Netflix, and Season 4 (the Hashira Training arc) recently dropped. The upcoming movie trilogy **Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle** will adapt the final arc, so now is the perfect time to catch up.

- **Genre**: Action/Dark Fantasy
- **Episodes**: 55+ plus films
- **Best for**: Viewers who want stunning animation and emotional storytelling

#### 3. Chainsaw Man

**Chainsaw Man** is not your average shonen. Based on Tatsuki Fujimoto's manga, the series follows **Denji**, a teenager who merges with his pet devil-dog Pochita to become a chainsaw-powered demon hunter. He's broke, orphaned, and just wants to eat a nice meal and sleep in a real bed.

The series blends workplace comedy with ultra-violent action in a way that feels completely fresh. The animation from MAPPA is stunning, and the film adaptation — **Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc** — was one of the biggest anime theatrical releases of 2025.

- **Genre**: Dark action, dark comedy
- **Episodes**: 12 (Season 1)
- **Best for**: Fans of irreverent, adult-oriented action anime

#### 4. One Piece

Yes, **One Piece** has over 1,100 episodes. No, you don't need to watch them all. But once you fall in love with **Monkey D. Luffy** and his crew, each arc pulls you deeper into one of the most ambitious stories in all of fiction.

Netflix has a significant chunk of the series, and the ongoing **Egghead Island arc** (currently airing) is considered by many fans to be the best content in the entire series. If the episode count is daunting, start at episode 517 (the Fishman Island arc, after the timeskip) for a clean entry point.

- **Genre**: Action/Adventure
- **Episodes**: 1,100+ (partial selection on Netflix)
- **Best for**: Fans willing to commit to an epic long-running saga

---

### 🌸 Fantasy & Emotional

#### 5. Frieren: Beyond Journey's End

**Frieren** is a once-in-a-generation anime. Following an elven mage who outlives the human heroes she adventured with, the series explores **grief, memory, and what it means to connect** with people whose lives are so much shorter than your own.

The animation is breathtaking, the writing is deeply thoughtful, and the final act delivers action sequences that rival anything in the shonen genre. Frieren is currently rated as one of the highest-rated anime of all time on MyAnimeList.

- **Genre**: Fantasy, slice of life, emotional drama
- **Episodes**: 28
- **Best for**: Viewers who want depth and emotional resonance alongside beautiful animation

#### 6. Violet Evergarden

**Violet Evergarden** is one of the most visually stunning anime ever produced. Following a former child soldier who becomes a letter-writer in a post-war world, the series deals with **trauma, emotional growth, and the power of human connection** in ways that will genuinely move you to tears.

Produced by Kyoto Animation, each episode is a standalone story that slowly builds Violet's understanding of human emotion. The feature film **Violet Evergarden: The Movie** is also available and serves as a perfect conclusion.

- **Genre**: Drama, fantasy, slice of life
- **Episodes**: 13 + specials + film
- **Best for**: Anyone who wants a beautifully crafted emotional journey

#### 7. A Silent Voice (Movie)

**A Silent Voice** (*Koe no Katachi*) is one of the finest anime films ever made. The story follows **Shoya**, a former bully who tormented a deaf classmate named Shoko in elementary school, and his attempt to make amends years later.

This is a film about bullying, guilt, redemption, and the difficulty of forgiving yourself. It handles heavy subject matter with tremendous sensitivity and care. The animation is exquisite throughout.

- **Genre**: Drama, romance
- **Length**: Film (~130 minutes)
- **Best for**: Viewers who want a profound standalone anime experience

---

### 🤖 Sci-Fi & Mecha

#### 8. Neon Genesis Evangelion

**Neon Genesis Evangelion** changed anime forever. Released in 1995, this mecha series begins as a fairly conventional story about teenagers piloting giant robots to fight alien threats — then slowly, brilliantly deconstructs everything you thought you knew about the genre.

The final episodes of the original series are among the most discussed, analyzed, and debated episodes in anime history. The **End of Evangelion** film is also on Netflix. If you've never watched Eva, this is essential viewing.

- **Genre**: Mecha, psychological, sci-fi
- **Episodes**: 26 + film
- **Best for**: Viewers who want anime that challenges and provokes as much as it entertains

#### 9. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners

Set in the world of **Cyberpunk 2077**, **Edgerunners** is a 10-episode Netflix Original produced by Studio Trigger. Following **David Martinez**, a street kid trying to survive in Night City who becomes a mercenary outlaw, the series manages to do something rare: it made fans love the Cyberpunk universe even more than the game.

The animation is kinetic and gorgeous. The story is compact and hits incredibly hard by the finale. This is peak Trigger — the studio that made Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagann.

- **Genre**: Sci-fi action, cyberpunk
- **Episodes**: 10
- **Best for**: Fans of Cyberpunk 2077, fans of stylish action animation

#### 10. Gurren Lagann

**Gurren Lagann** is the most aggressively optimistic anime ever made. In a future where humanity lives underground, **Simon** and his brother-figure **Kamina** start a rebellion that escalates from digging tunnels to fighting in mechs to literally drilling through the universe.

The show is an unrelenting celebration of human potential, willpower, and the refusal to give up. If you want an anime that will make you feel genuinely pumped about being alive, Gurren Lagann is it.

- **Genre**: Mecha, action, adventure
- **Episodes**: 27
- **Best for**: Viewers who want high-energy, inspirational anime with heart

### 🔪 Horror & Dark

#### 11. Beastars (Seasons 1–3)

**Beastars** takes place in a world of anthropomorphic animals where carnivores and herbivores coexist uneasily under strict social rules. At the center is **Legoshi**, a wolf who struggles with his predatory nature while falling for a rabbit.

What sounds like a quirky premise becomes a genuinely sophisticated exploration of desire, identity, prejudice, and social hierarchy. The CGI animation (unusual for anime) works perfectly here. Season 3, the final arc, arrives on Netflix in **March 2026**.

- **Genre**: Drama, psychological, mystery
- **Episodes**: 24 + Season 3 (coming March 2026)
- **Best for**: Fans of character-driven drama and unique worldbuilding

#### 12. Dorohedoro

**Dorohedoro** is one of the most distinctive anime on Netflix. Set in a surreal dystopian world divided between a poverty-stricken city and a realm of sorcerers, it follows **Caiman** — a man with a reptile head and amnesia — searching for the sorcerer who cursed him.

It's violent, weird, funny, and deeply original. The character designs are unlike anything else in anime, and the dark humor runs throughout. Highly recommended for fans of off-beat, mature anime.

- **Genre**: Dark fantasy, action, dark comedy
- **Episodes**: 12
- **Best for**: Viewers who want something genuinely different from mainstream anime

---

### 🏆 Sports & Competition

#### 13. Haikyu!! (All Seasons)

**Haikyu!!** is one of the best sports anime ever made — and possibly the best gateway anime for newcomers. Following a volleyball team at a high school in rural Japan, the series makes every serve, spike, and rally feel like the most important thing in the world.

You don't need to know or like volleyball. The characters are so well-written and the matches are so expertly paced that it doesn't matter. All seasons are on Netflix, along with the recent film adaptations.

- **Genre**: Sports, drama
- **Episodes**: 85
- **Best for**: Anyone — genuinely one of the most universally accessible anime ever made

#### 14. Kuroko's Basketball

**Kuroko's Basketball** (*Kuroko no Basuke*) follows **Kuroko**, a nearly invisible player on a high school basketball team, and his partnership with the ultra-talented **Kagami** as they take on the legendary "Generation of Miracles" — a group of prodigies who dominated middle school basketball.

Like Haikyu!!, this series makes basketball feel superhuman in the best way. The matches escalate beautifully across three seasons.

- **Genre**: Sports, action
- **Episodes**: 75
- **Best for**: Sports anime fans, basketball fans

---

### 😄 Comedy & Slice of Life

#### 15. Gintama

**Gintama** is a legend. One of the most beloved manga in *Weekly Shonen Jump* history, it ran for 13 years and its anime adaptation just made its Netflix debut in **January 2026**. Set in an alternate-history Edo Japan occupied by aliens, the series follows the lazy, silver-haired samurai **Gintoki Sakata** and his freelance odd-jobs business.

Gintama is primarily a comedy — and one of the funniest things you'll ever watch — but it periodically pivots to some of the most emotionally devastating serious arcs in anime. It's a masterpiece of tonal range.

- **Genre**: Comedy, action, historical
- **Episodes**: 367
- **Best for**: Viewers who want a long-running comedy with occasional serious depth

#### 16. Aggretsuko

**Aggretsuko** is a Netflix Original about a mild-mannered red panda named **Retsuko** who works an unfulfilling office job and secretly releases her rage by singing death metal at karaoke. It's both hilarious and surprisingly resonant.

The series has run for 5 seasons and covers topics like workplace stress, relationships, toxic bosses, social media, and career anxiety in ways that feel genuinely relatable.

- **Genre**: Comedy, slice of life, music
- **Episodes**: 50+
- **Best for**: Working adults who need to see their frustrations reflected back with humor

### 🎬 Netflix Originals

#### 17. Arcane (Season 2)

Technically animated in France rather than Japan, **Arcane** is based on *League of Legends* and has become one of the most acclaimed animated series in history. The second season (2024) concluded the story of **Vi**, **Jinx**, and **Jayce** in the cities of Piltover and Zaun.

If you haven't seen Arcane, watch both seasons immediately. The animation is unlike anything else on this list — more Western in style, but with an anime sensibility in its emotional depth.

- **Genre**: Action, fantasy, drama
- **Episodes**: 18 (9 per season)
- **Best for**: Viewers who want an animated epic with premium production values

#### 18. Blue Eye Samurai

Another non-traditional anime, **Blue Eye Samurai** is a Netflix Original set in 17th-century Japan. It follows **Mizu**, a mixed-race swordsperson seeking vengeance against the European men who could be her father.

The animation is stunning — mixing 2D and CGI seamlessly — and the action sequences are extraordinary. Season 2 is currently in production.

- **Genre**: Historical, action, revenge drama
- **Episodes**: 8 (Season 1)
- **Best for**: Fans of mature, cinematic animated storytelling

#### 19. Pluto

Based on Naoki Urasawa's reimagining of Osamu Tezuka's *Astro Boy*, **Pluto** is a murder mystery set in a future where robots and humans coexist. The world's most powerful robots are being destroyed one by one, and robot detective **Gesicht** is on the case.

This is prestige anime — slow-burning, deeply philosophical, and emotionally devastating. One of the best anime of 2024.

- **Genre**: Sci-fi, mystery, drama
- **Episodes**: 8
- **Best for**: Fans of cerebral, mature sci-fi storytelling

### 🗡️ Classic Essentials

#### 20. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

**FMA: Brotherhood** is frequently cited as the greatest anime ever made — and it's easy to see why. Following brothers **Edward and Alphonse Elric**, who use alchemy to try to restore their bodies after a failed resurrection attempt, the series builds an intricate world and delivers a story with virtually no wasted moments.

#### 21. Hunter x Hunter (2011)

**Hunter x Hunter** follows **Gon Freecss**, a boy who discovers his father is a legendary Hunter and sets out to find him. What begins as a fairly standard adventure series evolves into one of the most complex, subversive, and emotionally challenging anime ever created.

The Chimera Ant arc (episodes 76–136) is widely considered one of the greatest narrative achievements in anime history. Don't be fooled by the early episodes' lighthearted tone — this series goes very dark.

- **Genre**: Adventure, action, dark fantasy
- **Episodes**: 148
- **Best for**: Viewers who want an adventure series with genuine depth and complexity

#### 22. Cowboy Bebop

**Cowboy Bebop** is where many Western anime fans started. The 26-episode jazz-infused space western follows bounty hunter **Spike Spiegel** and his crew across a solar system of crime, grief, and nostalgia.

Every episode is a genre exercise — noir, comedy, western, horror, romance — united by Yoko Kanno's legendary soundtrack. It's as good as people say.

- **Best for**: Fans of heist stories and ensemble casts

#### 24. The Way of the Househusband

**The Way of the Househusband** follows **Tatsu**, a legendary yakuza boss who retires to become a stay-at-home husband. The entire series is watching this terrifying man apply his yakuza intensity to grocery shopping, cooking, and household chores.

The comedy is consistent and the gag-manga format makes it easy to watch in short bursts. Perfect for when you want something light.

- **Genre**: Comedy, slice of life
- **Episodes**: 20+ (in short episode format)
- **Best for**: Anyone who wants something easy and funny

#### 25. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

**JoJo's Bizarre Adventure** is exactly what the name suggests. Each season follows a different member of the Joestar family across different time periods, with increasingly elaborate supernatural powers (called Stands) and increasingly ridiculous enemies.

Parts 1–5 are on Netflix. The highly anticipated **Steel Ball Run** adaptation — adapting what many fans consider the best arc in the manga — is coming to Netflix in **March 2026**.
