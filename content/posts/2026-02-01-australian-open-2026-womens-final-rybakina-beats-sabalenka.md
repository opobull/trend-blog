## What Happened

Elena Rybakina claimed her second Grand Slam title at the 2026 Australian Open, defeating world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-4 4-6 6-4 in a three-set final on Saturday, January 31. The victory marks her first major title since winning Wimbledon in 2022.

The match took place under a closed roof at Rod Laver Arena due to light rain, with approximately 15,000 spectators in attendance.

## Match Summary

Rybakina took control early, winning the first set 6-4 with her powerful serve and flat groundstrokes. Sabalenka fought back in the second set, capitalizing on Rybakina's service struggles at 4-5 to level the match.

The decisive third set saw Sabalenka break early, but Rybakina remained composed. She broke back and held her nerve to close out the championship with minimal celebration—a brief clenched fist and nod to her team.

### Set-by-Set Results

| Set | Rybakina | Sabalenka |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| 1st | **6** | 4 |
| 2nd | 4 | **6** |
| 3rd | **6** | 4 |

## Road to the Final

Rybakina's path to the title included victories over three top-10 players:

- **Quarterfinal**: Defeated No. 6 Jessica Pegula
- **Semifinal**: Defeated No. 2 Iga Swiatek
- **Final**: Defeated No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka

She became the first player since 2019 to win the Australian Open title by defeating top-10 opponents in each round from the quarterfinals onwards.

## Key Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| New World Ranking | No. 3 |
| Career Grand Slam Titles | 2 (Wimbledon 2022, AO 2026) |
| Wins Since Wimbledon 2025 | 38 (most on tour) |
| Current Form | 20-1 in last 21 matches |
| Record vs Top-10 | Won last 10 matches |
| H2H vs Sabalenka | 8-7 overall |

## Historical Significance

This was the 15th career meeting between Rybakina and Sabalenka—more than either has faced any other opponent on tour. Their previous Australian Open final meeting in 2023 went to Sabalenka, who used that victory as a springboard to establish herself as the dominant hard-court player.

Rybakina now holds the highest winning percentage against reigning world No. 1 players (minimum 10 meetings) since WTA rankings began in 1975, at 60.0%.

## Player Reactions

"I always believed I can come back to the level I was, but we all have ups and downs," Rybakina said after the match. "I thought maybe I will never again be in the final, or even get a trophy. When you are getting big wins against top players, then you start to believe more and you get more confident."

Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash praised her potential: "Could she grab two Grand Slams in a year? Yes—and that will certainly edge her more towards the number one ranking in the world. When she is hot, she is just about unstoppable."

## What's Next

Rybakina's victory positions her as a strong contender for the remaining Grand Slams in 2026. Wimbledon, where she won her first major, presents a clear opportunity to add to her collection. The next Grand Slam is the French Open in late May.
