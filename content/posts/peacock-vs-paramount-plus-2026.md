Peacock and Paramount+ are the two most underrated streaming services of 2026. While Netflix, Max, and Disney+ dominate headlines, these two budget-friendly platforms offer enormous content libraries at significantly lower prices — often with free tiers that rival what you'd pay for elsewhere.

If you're trying to decide whether to subscribe to **Peacock**, **Paramount+**, or both — this is the complete comparison you need.

---

## The Short Answer

- **Choose Peacock** if you want a free tier, NBC content, Premier League soccer, WWE, or the Universal movie library
- **Choose Paramount+** if you want Star Trek, Showtime content, CBS network access, Nickelodeon, or the best live local TV coverage
- **Choose both** — at their base prices ($4.99 + $5.99 = $10.98/month), they're cheaper than a single Netflix Standard plan

## Pricing: Peacock vs Paramount+ in 2026

### Peacock Plans

| Plan | Price/Month | Ads | Content Access |
|------|------------|-----|----------------|
| Peacock Free | $0 | Yes | Limited selection |
| Peacock Premium | $4.99 | Yes | Full library |
| Peacock Premium Plus | $9.99 | No | Full library + downloads |

Peacock's **free tier** is its biggest advantage over every competitor. You get over 13,000 hours of content without paying a cent — though the selection excludes premium originals and live sports. It's a genuine free tier, not just a trial.

The **Premium plan at $4.99** is one of the best deals in streaming: access to the full Peacock library including live sports, NBCUniversal content, and originals, with a manageable ad load.

**Premium Plus at $9.99** removes ads and adds offline downloads for select titles.

### Paramount+ Plans

| Plan | Price/Month | Ads | Showtime | Local CBS |
|------|------------|-----|----------|-----------|
| Essential (with Ads) | $5.99 | Yes | No | No |
| Premium (No Ads) | $9.99 | No | No | Yes |
| Paramount+ with Showtime | $11.99 | No | Yes | Yes |

Paramount+ has no free tier, but its **Essential plan at $5.99** is competitive — and includes access to the full on-demand library (45,000+ episodes). The **Premium plan** adds ad-free viewing and live local CBS stations.

The **Paramount+ with Showtime bundle at $11.99/month** is a significant value addition — Showtime is a premium cable network with acclaimed original series, and getting it bundled for just $2 more than the ad-free plan is excellent value.

**Student discount**: Paramount+ offers 25% off to students with a valid .edu email — a meaningful saving that Peacock doesn't match.

### Winner: Peacock (on entry price and free tier)

Peacock's $0 free tier and $4.99 Premium plan are unmatched. However, Paramount+'s Showtime bundle dramatically improves its value proposition at higher tiers.

## Originals: Best Shows on Each Platform

### Must-Watch Peacock Originals

---

## Device Support

Both services work on essentially all major platforms:

- Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Vizio, Sony)
- Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV
- iOS and Android
- PlayStation and Xbox
- Web browsers
- Chromecast/Google TV

No meaningful difference — both cover all major devices.

## Who Should Choose Peacock?

**Peacock is the better choice if you:**
- Want any free content without paying (the only major service with a real free tier)
- Watch Premier League soccer regularly
- Love NBC shows (*The Office*, *Parks and Rec*, SNL, current NBC primetime)
- Are a WWE fan (Peacock has exclusive US WWE rights)
- Want the Universal Pictures movie library
- Want the most channels for the lowest price
- Are on an extremely tight budget ($4.99/month for Premium)

**Best Peacock value**: Premium at $4.99/month is excellent value. Free tier if you want to try risk-free.

---

## Who Should Choose Paramount+?

**Paramount+ is the better choice if you:**
- Are a Star Trek fan — Strange New Worlds alone is worth the subscription
- Watch *Yellowjackets* or other Paramount+ prestige dramas
- Want CBS network access (live sports, news, local CBS shows)
- Are in the Taylor Sheridan universe (Yellowstone, 1923, Tulsa King)
- Want Champions League soccer
- Value Showtime content (Yellowjackets, Billions, Dexter: New Blood)
- Want the Paramount film library (Mission: Impossible, Top Gun, Godfather)
- Watch Nickelodeon with family (SpongeBob, TMNT, etc.)

**Best Paramount+ value**: The **Paramount+ with Showtime bundle at $11.99/month** — getting Showtime's entire catalog for just $2 more than the base Premium plan is exceptional value.

---

## Should You Subscribe to Both?

At their lowest paid tiers: Peacock Premium ($4.99) + Paramount+ Essential ($5.99) = **$10.98/month**. That's less than Netflix's ad-supported tier and gives you:

- 125,000+ hours of combined content
- Universal AND Paramount movie libraries
- NBC AND CBS network content
- Premier League AND Champions League soccer
- WWE events
- Star Trek, Yellowjackets, Poker Face, Tulsa King, Strange New Worlds

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Peacock or Paramount+ cheaper?**
Peacock is cheaper — it has a free tier and a $4.99/month Premium plan. Paramount+ starts at $5.99/month. However, Paramount+'s $11.99 Showtime bundle offers exceptional value at the higher tier.

**Does Peacock have a free trial?**
Peacock's free tier is essentially a permanent free trial — you get 13,000+ hours without paying. Promotional paid trials are occasionally offered for new subscribers.

**Is Paramount+ worth it for sports?**
Yes, if you watch Champions League soccer, NFL (CBS games), SEC college football, or NWSL. For Premier League soccer or WWE, Peacock is essential.

**Can I watch The Office on Paramount+?**
No — The Office moved exclusively to Peacock in 2021 and remains a Peacock exclusive. It is not on Paramount+, Netflix, or any other service.

**Is Yellowstone on Paramount+?**
Yes — all seasons of Yellowstone are on Paramount+. The spinoffs (1923, 6666, Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown) are also exclusively on Paramount+.

**Does Peacock have 4K streaming?**
Peacock offers limited 4K content on the Premium Plus plan. The catalog of 4K titles is smaller than Netflix or Max.

**Which has better original shows?**
Paramount+ has the stronger prestige originals catalog — Strange New Worlds, Yellowjackets, and the Taylor Sheridan universe are all excellent. Peacock's *Poker Face* is a standout but the overall originals slate is thinner.

---

## Conclusion

Peacock and Paramount+ both offer remarkable value at a time when streaming prices are rising across the board. They're the best argument for looking beyond Netflix.

**Our recommendations**:
- **Best budget pick**: Peacock Free (literally free) or Peacock Premium ($4.99)
- **Best prestige content**: Paramount+ with Showtime ($11.99) — Strange New Worlds + Yellowjackets + Showtime is unbeatable
- **Best sports combo**: Both services at base tiers ($10.98/month) — Premier League + Champions League + NFL from both packages
- **Best single value**: Paramount+ with Showtime bundle

Neither service should replace Netflix or Max for most viewers — but as **second or third subscriptions**, they offer more value than almost anything else in streaming.
