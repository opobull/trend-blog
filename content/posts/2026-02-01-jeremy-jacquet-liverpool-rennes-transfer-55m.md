## What Happened

Liverpool have agreed a deal with French club Rennes for the signing of defender Jeremy Jacquet. The transfer is expected to be worth £55 million plus £5 million in add-ons, with personal terms not anticipated to be an issue. The move is set for the summer window.

The 20-year-old France youth international becomes the latest young talent in Liverpool's rebuild for the next generation.

## Key Details

### Why Liverpool Chose Jacquet Over Guehi

Liverpool pursued Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guehi last summer, but a £35 million move collapsed on deadline day. The England international subsequently joined Manchester City this January.

Liverpool's scouting model views Jacquet as a more valuable long-term acquisition than Guehi, prompting the push to sign the French defender despite the higher price tag.

### Part of Liverpool's Youth Revolution

Jacquet joins an impressive list of young talents Liverpool have brought in as they build a team for the next generation:

| Player | Position | Signed |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Florian Wirtz | Midfielder | Summer 2025 |
| Hugo Ekitike | Forward | Summer 2025 |
| Milos Kerkez | Defender | Summer 2025 |
| Alexander Isak | Forward | Summer 2025 |
| Jeremy Jacquet | Defender | Summer 2026 (agreed) |

### Chelsea Also Interested

Chelsea had been in talks with Rennes over a proposed move for Jacquet as recently as January 18, according to The Athletic. Arsenal had also held long-term interest following his impressive loan spell at Clermont Foot, but they ultimately signed Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia instead.

### Current Form at Rennes

Jacquet has started every Ligue 1 match for which he has been available this season. He played every minute before receiving a red card against Paris Saint-Germain on December 6. The defender came through Rennes' youth ranks and has represented France at under-21 level.

## Why Liverpool Need a Centre-Back

Injuries to Joe Gomez and Giovanni Leoni have left Liverpool short in depth at centre-back this season, with only Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk as reliable options. Adding urgency to the situation, Konaté's contract is set to expire in the summer.

## Transfer Details

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Fee | £55 million |
| Add-ons | £5 million |
| Total Potential | £60 million |

| Move Date | Summer 2026 |
