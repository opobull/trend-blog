## What Happened

Tampa Bay Lightning captain Victor Hedman is set to return to the lineup for the 2026 Navy Federal Credit Union NHL Stadium Series game against the Boston Bruins on Sunday, February 2, 2026. The star defenseman has been sidelined since December 9, 2025, following elbow surgery.

The outdoor game will be held at Raymond James Stadium, the 65,000-seat home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with puck drop scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET.

## Return Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Dec. 9, 2025 | Hedman injured vs. Montreal Canadiens (6-1 win) |
| Dec. 11, 2025 | Placed on injured reserve, underwent surgery |
| Jan. 31, 2026 | Practice at Raymond James Stadium |
| Feb. 2, 2026 | Expected return vs. Boston Bruins |

## Coach Confirms Return

Lightning head coach Jon Cooper confirmed Hedman's return following Saturday's practice, which was held inside a protective tent structure at Raymond James Stadium.

"Barring him coming in saying no, which I think is extremely doubtful, most likely he'll play," Cooper said. "Sweden, the country Sweden, can take a huge breath."

At the end of practice, teammates gathered in a circle around Hedman at center ice and tapped their sticks in a show of support.

## Hedman's Season Stats

Before his injury, Hedman had recorded 12 assists in 18 games while averaging 21:05 of ice time per game. He is the Lightning's career leader in games played (1,149) and leads all Tampa Bay defensemen in career goals, assists, and points.

## Olympics Next

Hedman was named to Team Sweden for the Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. Sweden's opening game is scheduled for February 11 against host Italy. The Stadium Series game served as motivation for his recovery.

"Playing in this game has been a big motivation in me coming back," Hedman told NHL.com. "I felt good out there. All the signs are positive."

Tampa Bay has performed well despite multiple injuries to key players this season:

| Brayden Point | C | Limited to 37 GP |
| Ryan McDonagh | D | Limited to 19 GP |
| Erik Cernak | D | Limited to 33 GP |

Since Hedman's injury, the team has gone 17-3-2.
