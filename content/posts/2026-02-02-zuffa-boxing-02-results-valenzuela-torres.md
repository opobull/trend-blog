## Main Event: Valenzuela Returns to Winning Ways

Jose "Rayo" Valenzuela made a successful Zuffa Boxing debut on Sunday at the Meta APEX in Las Vegas, outpointing Diego Torres over 10 rounds in a lightweight bout.

Returning from almost a year-long layoff after losing his WBA super lightweight title to Gary Antuanne Russell, Valenzuela showed championship-caliber boxing skills despite facing a determined Torres who drew blood in the fourth round.

All three judges scored the fight 99-91 in favor of Valenzuela, who improved to 15-3.

"He came out strong, I tasted the fire and smelled blood," Valenzuela said after the victory. "I'm a fighter. These people pay hard-earned money."

## Key Moments

Torres (22-2) came out aggressively and landed a left hand in the fourth round that opened a cut beside Valenzuela's right eye. The Mexican southpaw responded by executing superior footwork and movement to neutralize Torres' power attacks.

A big right by Torres wobbled Valenzuela in the sixth, but the former champion's polish and experience proved decisive as he outboxed Torres down the stretch to earn comfortable scorecards.

## Kalajdzic Pulls Off Stunning Upset

In the night's most dramatic fight, Radivoje "Hot Rod" Kalajdzic overcame two knockdowns to stop former WBC light heavyweight champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk at 2:47 of the seventh round.

Gvozdyk (21-3) dropped Kalajdzic early in the first round and again in the fourth, seemingly on his way to an easy victory. But the 38-year-old Ukrainian faded late as Kalajdzic (30-3) followed his corner's instructions.

"They told me to believe in myself, stay behind the jab and throw the right – and it worked," Kalajdzic said.

Gvozdyk, who won the WBC title by stopping Adonis Stevenson in 2018, returned from a three-year layoff in 2024 and had gone the distance with David Benavidez in his previous outing.

## Bohachuk Edges Butaev in Battle of Former Champions

The co-main event saw Serhii Bohachuk (27-3) earn a hard-fought split decision over Radzhab Butaev (16-2) in a 10-round middleweight clash between fighters from warring nations.

Two judges scored it 96-94 for the Ukrainian, while the third had the same score for the Russian. Bohachuk applied constant pressure and landed the harder shots throughout, especially effective with his right hand.

The win was crucial for Bohachuk, who had lost two of his last four fights, including his WBC interim 154lb title to Vergil Ortiz Jr. and a September defeat to Brandon Adams.
