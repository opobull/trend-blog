## What Happened

Hayley Williams, the frontwoman of Paramore, has launched a new band called Power Snatch with frequent collaborator Daniel James. The duo debuted their new single "Assignment" on Apple Music 1 on January 29, 2026, officially announcing the project to the world.

Daniel James previously worked with Williams as the producer of her 2025 solo album, *Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party*, which earned critical acclaim and four Grammy nominations for the 2026 ceremony.

## Three Singles Released

Since the announcement, fans discovered that Power Snatch had actually been teasing the project since mid-2025. The band has released three singles so far:

### "Assignment"

The track announced on Apple Music 1 is the heaviest of the three releases. The song features intense, high-energy instrumentals, with some fans on social media drawing comparisons to artists like Buckethead.

### "DMs"

Released on Bandcamp, "DMs" takes on a melancholic, shoegaze-inspired sound. Williams sings about an ex over grungy, distorted guitars, with lyrics including: "Where I should keep this memory, that version of me / She was real but she was weak, weak in the knees."

### Untitled Track

An untitled song was previewed on the band's Instagram account (@powersnatched) back in July 2025. This track features a more lively, slightly unsettling vibe with abstract instrumentals. In the preview, Williams delivers tongue-in-cheek lyrics like "I think about Wayne's World the way some folks think about The Godfather."

## Williams' Musical Vision

The new project aligns with Williams' stated desire to explore multiple musical avenues. In an October 2025 interview with Rolling Stone, she expressed her ambition to "be in 100 bands before I die," explaining that she felt that was "the speed I work best in."

Speaking to Kerrang!, Williams had also discussed taking a break from Paramore to focus on solo work: "It wasn't time to make another Paramore record, but I had a lot of shit to say, so I've done what I've done for myself and made this record."

She added that she sees the band's future as cyclical: "Paramore will always have its time because it's just what we do. We cycle back in and out of it."

## What's Next

While Power Snatch has now released music, live shows may be a while off. Williams is currently preparing for a major global tour in support of *Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party*, which was recently extended due to overwhelming demand. The tour kicks off in March 2026 and will cover North America and Europe.
