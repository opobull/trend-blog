## Funk Meets Classical in Detroit

On **Saturday, January 31, 2026**, the Detroit Opera House hosted a historic musical event: **Symphonic PFunk: Celebrating the Music of Parliament-Funkadelic**. The concert marked the first time Parliament-Funkadelic's iconic funk music was performed by a full orchestra.

## What Happened

George Clinton, the 84-year-old founder of Parliament-Funkadelic, took the stage alongside the Detroit Opera Orchestra to perform orchestral arrangements of P-Funk's greatest hits. The show featured 47 orchestra members playing standard classical instruments including violins, cellos, French horns, and a harp.

Ray Chew, an Emmy-winning musical director, served as arranger and conductor. He created new arrangements that translated the group's funk catalog into orchestral form while maintaining the original groove.

## Clinton's Reaction

"I've been waiting on it to happen over the years," Clinton told the Associated Press. "We knew we were going to be doing this one day. We expected to gravitate into classical or something."

The P-Funk legend noted that the music always had sophisticated arrangements: "The colors that are already in the music are going to be spoken through violins and French horns and everything. We don't even have to invent new notes. All the notes are there."

## Why Detroit?

The concert location held special significance. Clinton's relationship with Detroit dates back to 1967 when The Parliaments' "(I Wanna) Testify" became a hit for Detroit-based Revilot Records.

"To go back there now feels really good," Clinton said. "I feel a future coming in the place where we have a helluva past. That's where all the music was born."

## The Legacy of P-Funk

Parliament-Funkadelic formed in the 1950s as a doo-wop group called The Parliaments in Plainfield, New Jersey. By the 1970s, Clinton had developed the "Parliafunkadelicamentthang" — blending psychedelic rock, soul, and Afrofuturism into a revolutionary sound.

Key P-Funk members included:
- Bernie Worrell (keyboards)
- Garry Shider (guitar, vocals)
- Walter "Junie" Morrison (multi-instrumentalist)

## What's Next for Clinton

Clinton, now 84, confirmed he's working on new albums and the group has been touring continuously for the past three years. A new version of the famous "Mothership" stage prop — first used in 1976 — is currently under construction.
