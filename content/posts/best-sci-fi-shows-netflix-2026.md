Netflix may have said goodbye to *Stranger Things* in 2025, but the streamer's sci-fi library has never been stronger. From mind-bending time travel thrillers to existential alien contact dramas, Netflix offers the best collection of science fiction shows available on any streaming platform in 2026.

Whether you're looking for dystopian nightmares, cerebral mysteries, or pure escapist space opera, this is every sci-fi show on Netflix worth your time — ranked by how hard they'll rewire your brain.

- **Mind-blowing factor** (how hard does it mess with your head?)

## The 20 Best Sci-Fi Shows on Netflix Right Now

### 1. Dark (2017–2020)
**Seasons**: 3 | **Episodes**: 26 | **Rating**: 95% on Rotten Tomatoes

*Dark* is the greatest sci-fi show Netflix has ever produced — and it's not even close. This German masterpiece starts as a missing-child mystery in a small town and evolves into the most intricately plotted time-travel saga ever put on television.

Spanning four families across multiple timelines (1888, 1921, 1953, 1986, 2019, 2052), *Dark* demands your full attention. You'll need a family tree chart, a timeline diagram, and probably a philosophy degree to fully grasp it — but the payoff is extraordinary. Every question gets answered, every detail matters, and the finale sticks the landing perfectly.

**Why it's #1**: No other sci-fi show has matched *Dark*'s combination of narrative complexity, emotional depth, and intellectual rigor. It's the *Ulysses* of TV sci-fi.

**Watch if you like**: *The OA*, *12 Monkeys*, Christopher Nolan films, shows that treat you like an adult

**Note**: Watch in German with subtitles. The English dub loses the atmosphere.

---

### 2. Stranger Things (2016–2025)
**Seasons**: 5 | **Episodes**: 52 | **Rating**: 91% on Rotten Tomatoes

The show that put Netflix on the map. *Stranger Things* blends 1980s nostalgia, Spielberg-style wonder, and genuine horror into the most crowd-pleasing sci-fi series of the streaming era. What starts as a simple missing-kid mystery in small-town Indiana reveals a government conspiracy, parallel dimensions, and a telekinetic girl named Eleven who can flip vans with her mind.

The final season (released in late 2025) brought the saga to an emotionally satisfying conclusion, cementing *Stranger Things* as one of the defining TV shows of the 2010s–2020s. The fourth season was the most-streamed show of 2022, with viewers clocking 52 billion minutes.

**Why it's #2**: Pure entertainment value. No show on Netflix is easier to binge or more universally loved.

**Watch if you like**: *The Goonies*, Stephen King, *E.T.*, *It*, *Super 8*

**New in 2026**: *Stranger Things: Tales From '85*, an animated spin-off featuring the original cast fighting new supernatural threats, premieres in 2026.

---

### 3. 3 Body Problem (2024–)
**Seasons**: 1 (Season 2 coming 2026) | **Episodes**: 8 | **Rating**: 77% on Rotten Tomatoes

The most ambitious sci-fi series Netflix has produced since *Stranger Things*. Based on Liu Cixin's Hugo Award-winning novel, *3 Body Problem* follows humanity's first contact with an alien civilization — and discovers the extraterrestrials are not coming in peace.

Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (*Game of Thrones*) deliver a slow-burn mystery that spans decades, continents, and eventually light-years. The series jumps between a fictional Cultural Revolution China, present-day Oxford, and a simulation of an alien world with three suns — and somehow makes it all coherent.

Season 2 is confirmed for 2026, with plans for a third and final season already greenlit. This is Netflix's current flagship sci-fi show, and it only gets bigger from here.

**Why it's #3**: The most intellectually challenging sci-fi on Netflix. Tackles big questions about humanity, morality, and survival with cinematic scope.

**Watch if you like**: *Arrival*, *Interstellar*, hard sci-fi, existential dread

---

### 4. Black Mirror (2011–)
**Seasons**: 6 | **Episodes**: 27 | **Rating**: 83% on Rotten Tomatoes

The *Twilight Zone* for the smartphone era. Each standalone episode explores the dark side of technology and human nature — social media nightmares, consciousness uploading, VR addiction, dating apps gone wrong, and more.

Creator Charlie Brooker's anthology format means you can start anywhere, but the first two seasons are near-perfect science fiction. Standout episodes include "San Junipero" (a beautiful romance set in a digital afterlife), "White Christmas" (starring Jon Hamm in a nested nightmare), and "USS Callister" (a *Star Trek* parody that becomes genuinely disturbing).

Netflix revived the show in 2016 after it originated on UK's Channel 4, and new episodes continue to drop sporadically. The sixth season arrived in 2023.

**Why it's #4**: The most consistently thought-provoking sci-fi series ever made. Every episode stays with you.

**Watch if you like**: *The Twilight Zone*, anthology shows, techno-paranoia, existential horror

**Start with**: "San Junipero" (S3E4) or "USS Callister" (S4E1)

---

### 5. The Umbrella Academy (2019–2024)
**Seasons**: 4 | **Episodes**: 36 | **Rating**: 85% on Rotten Tomatoes

Based on Gerard Way's graphic novels, *The Umbrella Academy* follows a dysfunctional family of superheroes trying to prevent multiple apocalypses across timelines. Think *X-Men* meets *The Royal Tenenbaums* with a killer soundtrack.

The show is wildly creative, emotionally grounded, and features one of TV's best characters in Klaus (Robert Sheehan), a drug-addicted medium who can talk to the dead. The series concluded with its fourth season in 2024, delivering a divisive but definitive ending.

**Why it's #5**: The perfect blend of superhero action, family drama, and time-travel chaos. Great music supervision too.

**Watch if you like**: *The Boys*, *Doom Patrol*, dysfunctional family dramas, genre-blending shows

---

### 6. Alice in Borderland (2020–2022)
**Seasons**: 2 | **Episodes**: 16 | **Rating**: 86% on Rotten Tomatoes

This Japanese survival thriller is *Squid Game* meets *Saw* meets *The Hunger Games*. A group of Tokyo residents find themselves transported to a deserted parallel Tokyo where they must compete in deadly games to survive.

Every episode features a new game with different rules, strategies, and horrifying consequences. The production design is stunning (empty Tokyo is genuinely eerie), and the mystery of what's really happening deepens with each season. The series concluded with Season 2 in late 2022.

**Why it's #6**: The most addictive death-game thriller on Netflix. Impossible to stop watching.

**Watch if you like**: *Squid Game*, *Battle Royale*, *Escape Room*, Japanese thriller cinema

---

### 7. Russian Doll (2019–2022)
**Seasons**: 2 | **Episodes**: 15 | **Rating**: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes

Natasha Lyonne stars as Nadia, a software engineer who dies at her 36th birthday party — and then wakes up at the same party, again and again. *Russian Doll* is *Groundhog Day* as a dark comedy-drama with time loops, quantum mechanics, and generational trauma.

The first season is a perfect 8-episode gem. Season 2 expands the concept with time-travel to 1982 New York, exploring Nadia's family history. Created by Lyonne, Amy Poehler, and Leslye Headland, it's sharp, funny, and deeply philosophical.

**Why it's #7**: The smartest time-loop show ever made. Lyonne's performance is iconic.

**Watch if you like**: *Groundhog Day*, *Edge of Tomorrow*, Charlie Kaufman films, time-loop stories

---

### 8. Love, Death & Robots (2019–)
**Seasons**: 3 | **Episodes**: 35 | **Rating**: 81% on Rotten Tomatoes

An anthology of adult-animated sci-fi shorts ranging from 6 to 17 minutes. Produced by Tim Miller (*Deadpool*) and David Fincher, each episode is a self-contained story with wildly different animation styles — photorealistic CGI, 2D anime, stop-motion, cel-shaded, hand-drawn, and more.

Highlights include "Zima Blue" (a Zen meditation on consciousness), "The Witness" (a neon-noir time loop), "Bad Travelling" (body horror at sea), and "Jibaro" (a surreal folklore nightmare). Some episodes are silly, some are profound, and a few are legitimately groundbreaking.

**Why it's #8**: The most visually stunning sci-fi anthology ever made. Perfect for short attention spans.

**Watch if you like**: *Heavy Metal*, *The Animatrix*, animation, short films, experimental storytelling

**Start with**: "Zima Blue" (S1E14), "The Witness" (S1E3), or "Bad Travelling" (S3E2)

---

### 9. Lost in Space (2018–2021)
**Seasons**: 3 | **Episodes**: 28 | **Rating**: 69% on Rotten Tomatoes

A modern reboot of the 1960s series. The Robinson family crash-lands on an alien planet and must survive while trying to reunite with the rest of their colonist fleet. *Lost in Space* is family-friendly sci-fi with genuine stakes, strong character work, and impressive visual effects.

The show concluded with a satisfying third season in 2021. It's not groundbreaking, but it's well-made comfort food sci-fi — think *Star Trek: Voyager* meets *The Swiss Family Robinson*.

**Why it's #9**: The best family-friendly sci-fi on Netflix. Great production values and a robot you'll genuinely care about.

**Watch if you like**: *Star Trek*, space exploration, family adventure, feel-good endings

---

### 10. The OA (2016–2019)
**Seasons**: 2 | **Episodes**: 16 | **Rating**: 81% on Rotten Tomatoes

One of the most divisive shows Netflix has ever made — and one of the most ambitious. Brit Marling stars as Prairie, a blind woman who returns after seven years missing with her sight restored and a wild story about alternate dimensions, near-death experiences, and interpretive dance that can open portals.

Yes, you read that right. *The OA* is batshit insane, and that's exactly why it's brilliant. The show was cancelled after two seasons, leaving the story unfinished — but what exists is unlike anything else on TV.

**Why it's #10**: The weirdest, most unapologetically experimental sci-fi show on Netflix. You'll either love it or hate it.

**Watch if you like**: *Twin Peaks*, *Sense8*, arthouse cinema, taking big swings

**Warning**: Cancelled on a cliffhanger. The journey is worth it, but there's no ending.

---

### 11. Altered Carbon (2018–2020)
**Seasons**: 2 | **Episodes**: 18 | **Rating**: 76% on Rotten Tomatoes

Based on Richard K. Morgan's cyberpunk novels, *Altered Carbon* is set 300+ years in the future where consciousness can be digitized and bodies are interchangeable "sleeves." Joel Kinnaman (Season 1) and Anthony Mackie (Season 2) play Takeshi Kovacs, a soldier investigating a wealthy man's murder.

The show has *Blade Runner* aesthetics, noir plotting, and explores class inequality in a world where the rich can live forever by switching bodies. Season 1 is great; Season 2 is messier but still fun. Cancelled after two seasons.

**Why it's #11**: The most visually stunning cyberpunk show since *Blade Runner 2049*. Great world-building.

**Watch if you like**: *Blade Runner*, cyberpunk, noir mysteries, Philip K. Dick

---

### 12. Sense8 (2015–2018)
**Seasons**: 2 + finale special | **Episodes**: 24 | **Rating**: 86% on Rotten Tomatoes

From the Wachowskis (*The Matrix*), *Sense8* follows eight strangers across the globe who suddenly become psychically linked — able to share thoughts, skills, and senses. The show is a sprawling, joyous celebration of human connection, filmed on location in eight countries.

It's messy, melodramatic, and unapologetically earnest. The series was cancelled after Season 2 but got a two-hour finale movie to wrap up the story. *Sense8* has one of the most devoted fanbases of any Netflix show.

**Why it's #12**: The most emotionally generous sci-fi show ever made. It believes in people.

**Watch if you like**: The Wachowskis, ensemble casts, globe-trotting stories, optimistic sci-fi

---

### 13. Maniac (2018)
**Seasons**: 1 (limited series) | **Episodes**: 10 | **Rating**: 85% on Rotten Tomatoes

Emma Stone and Jonah Hill star in this surreal miniseries about two strangers who participate in a pharmaceutical trial for a drug designed to cure mental illness. The trial involves entering shared dream worlds — which become increasingly bizarre and genre-bending.

Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (*True Detective* Season 1), *Maniac* is visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and completely unpredictable. It's a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and end — no cliffhangers.

**Why it's #13**: The trippiest limited series on Netflix. Stone and Hill's chemistry is magical.

**Watch if you like**: *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, surrealism, anthology storytelling within a show

---

### 14. The Silent Sea (2021)
**Seasons**: 1 | **Episodes**: 8 | **Rating**: 64% on Rotten Tomatoes

This South Korean sci-fi thriller is set on a moon base where a team of scientists investigates a mysterious sample from an abandoned research facility. Think *The Thing* meets *Gravity* with K-drama sensibilities.

The show is gorgeously shot, tense, and emotionally grounded. It didn't get renewed for Season 2, but the first season tells a complete story.

**Why it's #14**: The best space horror on Netflix. Beautiful cinematography.

**Watch if you like**: *The Expanse*, *Moon*, Korean cinema, space thrillers

---

### 15. Archive 81 (2022)
**Seasons**: 1 | **Episodes**: 8 | **Rating**: 79% on Rotten Tomatoes

A found-footage horror series about a video archivist who restores tapes from a 1994 documentary about a mysterious apartment building — and discovers the documentarian is trapped in another dimension.

*Archive 81* blends analog horror aesthetics with genuine mystery. Unfortunately, it was cancelled after one season despite strong reviews. Still worth watching for horror-sci-fi fans.

**Why it's #15**: The creepiest found-footage show on Netflix. Great atmosphere.

**Watch if you like**: *The Ring*, analog horror, found footage, interdimensional stories

**Warning**: Cancelled on a cliffhanger.

---

### 16. Travelers (2016–2018)
**Seasons**: 3 | **Episodes**: 34 | **Rating**: 93% on Rotten Tomatoes

In the far future, humanity is dying. The last survivors send their consciousness back in time to inhabit the bodies of people in the 21st century moments before their deaths — hoping to change the timeline and prevent apocalypse.

*Travelers* is a smart, character-driven time-travel show with excellent ensemble acting. The series concluded with a definitive ending in Season 3. Originally a Canadian production, Netflix distributed it internationally.

**Why it's #16**: The most underrated time-travel show on Netflix. Consistently well-written.

**Watch if you like**: *12 Monkeys*, time-travel logic, character drama, ensemble casts

---

### 17. Raised by Wolves (2020–2022)
**Seasons**: 2 | **Episodes**: 18 | **Rating**: 74% on Rotten Tomatoes

Ridley Scott produced this deeply weird sci-fi series about two androids raising human children on a hostile alien planet. The show is part *Prometheus*, part biblical allegory, part body horror nightmare.

*Raised by Wolves* originally aired on HBO Max but moved to Netflix in some regions. It was cancelled after Season 2, leaving major questions unanswered. Still worth watching for fans of ambitious, swing-for-the-fences sci-fi.

**Why it's #17**: The most Ridley Scott thing Ridley Scott has made in years. Absolutely bonkers.

**Watch if you like**: *Prometheus*, *Westworld*, arthouse sci-fi, religious symbolism

**Note**: Availability varies by region. Check your Netflix library.

---

### 18. 1899 (2022)
**Seasons**: 1 | **Episodes**: 8 | **Rating**: 75% on Rotten Tomatoes

From the creators of *Dark*, *1899* follows passengers on a migrant steamship from Europe to New York who encounter a ghost ship adrift at sea. Reality begins to fracture, and nothing is as it seems.

The show has the same puzzle-box storytelling as *Dark* with gorgeous production design. Unfortunately, Netflix cancelled it after one season despite a massive cliffhanger. The cancellation remains controversial among fans.

**Why it's #18**: Visually stunning with *Dark*-level mystery. Heartbreaking it was cancelled.

**Watch if you like**: *Dark*, period pieces, mindfuck mysteries, shows that demand theories

**Warning**: Major unresolved cliffhanger. Watch only if cancellations don't bother you.

---

### 19. Kaos (2024)
**Seasons**: 1 | **Episodes**: 8 | **Rating**: 77% on Rotten Tomatoes

Jeff Goldblum plays Zeus in this modern-day reimagining of Greek mythology. When Zeus becomes paranoid that his downfall is imminent, a chain of events unfolds involving gods, mortals, and prophecies.

*Kaos* is darkly funny, visually inventive, and treats mythology as sci-fi. It's more fantasy than hard sci-fi, but the speculative elements qualify it for this list. Renewal status for Season 2 is pending as of early 2026.

**Why it's #19**: Jeff Goldblum as a neurotic Zeus is everything you want it to be.

**Watch if you like**: *American Gods*, Greek mythology, dark comedy, genre mash-ups

---

### 20. Night Sky (2022)
**Seasons**: 1 | **Episodes**: 8 | **Rating**: 69% on Rotten Tomatoes

Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons star as an elderly couple with a secret: their backyard shed contains a portal to another planet. When a mysterious stranger appears, their quiet routine is upended.

*Night Sky* is slow, meditative, and focused on character over spectacle. It's not for everyone, but fans of thoughtful, small-scale sci-fi will love it. Cancelled after one season.

**Why it's #20**: The quietest, most contemplative sci-fi on Netflix. Beautiful performances from Spacek and Simmons.

**Watch if you like**: *Midnight Special*, small-scale sci-fi, character-driven stories, slow burns

---
