## What Happened

Calum Hill delivered the round of his career at the Bahrain Championship, shooting an 11-under-par 61 to equal the course record at the Royal Golf Club. The Scottish golfer made 11 birdies without a single bogey to take a commanding four-shot lead at the halfway stage of the DP World Tour event.

The 24-year-old's flawless round matched the course record set by Brandon Robinson Thompson during the first round of the 2025 tournament.

## Second-Round Leaderboard

| 3 | Ugo Coussaud | France | -9 |

## How Hill Built His Lead

Hill opened with a birdie on the first hole, then picked up three consecutive birdies from the fourth to draw level with overnight leader Freddy Schott. He reached 11 under with birdies at the ninth and 10th holes.

Outstanding approach shots at the 13th and 14th set up two more birdies. After making par at the 15th, Hill finished with three consecutive birdies to complete his historic round.

"I started off really well then had a few bonus putts from really long range go in and I just kept making birdies," Hill said after the round. "I knew the course record was 11 under, so I knew I needed to hole my last shot to break it and it looked very good in the air. I thought it had a chance."

## Patrick Reed's Comeback Campaign

Patrick Reed, who won the Dubai Desert Classic last Sunday, shot a 5-under 67 with seven birdies to sit on 6 under for the tournament.

Earlier this week, Reed announced he was leaving LIV Golf and will play on the DP World Tour for the rest of the year. His goal is to finish high enough in the Race to Dubai standings to earn full PGA Tour status in 2027.
