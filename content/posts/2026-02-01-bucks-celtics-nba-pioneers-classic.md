The Boston Celtics host the Milwaukee Bucks in the inaugural NBA Pioneers Classic. This marks the second meeting between these Eastern Conference rivals this season, with the Bucks having won the first matchup.

## Team Standings

| Team | Record | Conference Rank | Last 10 |

| Milwaukee Bucks | 18-28 | 12th East | 2-8 |

The Celtics are tied with New York for second place in the Eastern Conference, 5.5 games behind first-place Detroit. The Bucks have struggled, sitting 12th in the East and 7.5 games behind the play-in spots.

## Key Injuries

### Milwaukee Bucks — Out
- **Giannis Antetokounmpo** (calf) — Out amid trade rumors
- **Kevin Porter Jr.** (oblique) — Out
- **Taurean Prince** (neck) — Out
- **Gary Harris** (hamstring) — Probable

### Boston Celtics
- **Jayson Tatum** (Achilles) — Out
- **Jaylen Brown** — Available (missed Friday's game)

## Offseason Changes

The Bucks made significant roster moves hoping to satisfy Giannis and keep him in Milwaukee:

| Departed | Arrived |
|----------|---------|
| Damian Lillard (waived) | Cole Anthony |
| Brook Lopez (FA) | Myles Turner |
| Pat Connaughton (FA) | Amir Coffey |
| Vasilije Micic (cut) | Gary Harris |

Despite these changes, Milwaukee has struggled to a 18-28 record. Trade deadline rumors suggest Giannis may be moved.

## Betting Lines

| Line | Value |
|------|-------|
| Spread | Celtics -12.5 |
| Over/Under | 217.5 points |
| Money Line | Celtics -617, Bucks +449 |

Boston enters as a heavy favorite. The last eight regular season meetings in Boston have averaged 234.3 combined points, suggesting a high-scoring affair.

## Key Matchups

**Derrick White vs Ryan Rollins**

Rollins has emerged as a key player for Milwaukee, averaging 16.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 1.6 steals per game while shooting 39.8% from three.

**Jaylen Brown vs Kyle Kuzma**

Kuzma had a strong first meeting against Boston with 31 points on 76.5% shooting. The Celtics need better perimeter defense on him.

## What to Watch

Both teams rank in the top two in three-point shooting:
- Celtics: 2nd in three-pointers made per game
- Bucks: 2nd in three-point percentage (39%)

However, both also rank in the bottom 10 in three-pointers allowed per game. Expect a high volume of perimeter shooting.
