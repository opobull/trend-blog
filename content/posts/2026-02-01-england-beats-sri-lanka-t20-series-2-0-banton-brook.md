## What Happened

England clinched the T20 series against Sri Lanka with a six-wicket victory in the second international at Pallekele. Tom Banton finished unbeaten on 54 off 33 balls as England successfully chased down a revised DLS target of 168 in 16.4 overs.

The win gives England an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with captain Harry Brook yet to lose a T20 series during his reign.

## Match Summary

### Sri Lanka Innings

Sri Lanka posted a competitive 189-5 after being inserted by England. Openers Pathum Nissanka and Kamil Mishara came out swinging, smashing 35 runs off the first two overs.

| Batsman | Runs | Balls | Key Moment |
|---------|------|-------|------------|
| Pavan Rathnayake | 40 | 22 | Top scorer |
| Pathum Nissanka | 34 | - | Dragged Archer onto stumps |
| Kusal Mendis | 32 | - | Dismissed by Dawson |

England's spinners controlled the middle overs, with Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson, and Will Jacks each taking a wicket. Jofra Archer finished with 2-42.

### England Chase

Rain interrupted play with England at 57-2 off 7.2 overs. When play resumed, the tourists faced a revised DLS target of 168 off 17 overs—requiring 111 from 9.4 overs.

| Batsman | Runs | Balls | Strike Rate |
|---------|------|-------|-------------|
| Tom Banton | 54* | 33 | 163.6 |
| Jos Buttler | 39 | 29 | 134.5 |
| Harry Brook | 36 | 12 | 300.0 |

Harry Brook's cameo proved decisive. The captain smashed four sixes—three consecutive bombs over the off side against Matheesha Pathirana—before falling to a scoop shot with 38 runs still needed.

Banton held his nerve to guide England home, with Sam Curran sealing victory with a six in the final over, finishing with two balls to spare.

## Key Performers

### Tom Banton

After dropping catches in the field, Banton made amends with the bat. His calculated aggression and ability to rotate strike under pressure strengthened his case for a starting spot at the upcoming T20 World Cup.

### Harry Brook

Despite arriving at the crease with England needing 87 from 7.5 overs, Brook delivered one of the most explosive cameos of the series. His 12-ball 36 (300 strike rate) turned an imposing chase into a manageable one.

### England Spin Department

The spinners delivered an economical 12 overs for 81 runs (6.75 economy) and three wickets—an encouraging sign ahead of the subcontinental World Cup.

## What's Next

England's victory sets them up well for the T20 World Cup, with their opening match against Nepal scheduled for February 8. The third and final T20I against Sri Lanka will complete the series.
