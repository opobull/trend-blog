## Match Overview

Paris Saint-Germain visit Stade de la Meinau on Sunday to face Strasbourg in Ligue 1 Matchday 20, seeking their sixth consecutive league victory.

## PSG's Position

Luis Enrique's side regained first place after Marseille defeated Lens 3-1 in their most recent fixture. PSG now hold a two-point advantage over Les Sang et Or.

**Recent Ligue 1 form:**
- Five consecutive league wins
- Two clean sheets in the last two outings
- Goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier leads the league with nine clean sheets

The Parisians have not lost a single Ligue 1 match this season when scoring first, though they have dropped six points in such scenarios, four of them away from home.

## Strasbourg's Revival

Strasbourg have experienced a resurgence under new manager Gary O'Neil, who replaced Liam Rosenior earlier this year.

**Under O'Neil:**
- Three consecutive competitive victories
- 12 goals scored, only 3 conceded in those games
- Currently seventh in the table

Le Racing are just one point behind Rennes for a Conference League spot and two points behind Lille for Europa League qualification.

Notably, Strasbourg beat PSG 2-1 in this exact fixture last season.
