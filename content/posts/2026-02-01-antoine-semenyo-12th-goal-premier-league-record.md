## What Happened

Antoine Semenyo has broken his personal Premier League goal-scoring record, netting his 12th goal of the 2025-26 season during Manchester City's match against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, February 1, 2026.

The Ghanaian forward, who joined Manchester City from Bournemouth in January 2026, scored the second goal for City before halftime. This goal surpassed his previous best of 11 Premier League goals, which he achieved during the entire 2024-25 season with Bournemouth.
