## 🔥 New & Trending on Max (2026)

### 1. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (2025)

The most-watched show on Max right now — a prequel to *Game of Thrones* and companion to *House of the Dragon*, set in Westeros nearly 100 years before Daenerys Targaryen's story. Based on George R.R. Martin's *Tales of Dunk and Egg* novellas, it follows wandering hedge knight Ser Duncan the Tall (Dunk) and his young squire Egg — who will one day become King Aegon V Targaryen.

**A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms** accomplishes something rare in the GoT universe: it's warm, optimistic, and genuinely fun — a medieval road trip through a world you already love, told on a human scale rather than the epic scale of its predecessors. The performances and production values are exceptional.

- **Episodes**: 6 (Season 1)
- **Best for**: Game of Thrones fans, fantasy lovers who want something more intimate than HOTD

### 2. The Pitt (2025)

**The Pitt** took home the Golden Globe for Best Drama Series in 2026 — a remarkable achievement for a new show. Set in a Pittsburgh hospital trauma center, the series follows a single grueling 15-hour shift in the emergency department, with one episode per hour of that shift.

The concept sounds gimmicky but is executed with extraordinary craft. Noah Wyle (returning to medical drama after ER) won the Globe for Best Actor, and the ensemble cast — each playing a specific trauma role — is exceptional. **The Pitt** captures the chaos and moral weight of emergency medicine in a way no show has since ER at its peak.

- **Episodes**: Season 2 currently releasing (Thursday drops)
- **Best for**: Medical drama fans, anyone who loved ER or Grey's Anatomy's better seasons

### 3. Heated Rivalry (2025)

The Canadian import that has become Max's most talked-about new drama. **Heated Rivalry** is an erotic drama about two rival hockey players — one American, one Canadian — whose competitive relationship conceals a secret affair that unfolds across years of their careers.

Prestige production values, excellent performances, and a story that takes its subject matter seriously make this far more than its high-concept premise suggests. The hockey sequences are among the best sports action on television.

- **Best for**: Sports drama fans, LGBTQ+ drama enthusiasts, prestige TV watchers

### 4. Industry (Season 4, 2025)

**Industry** follows young bankers navigating the brutal, amoral world of a London investment bank. Season 4 continues raising the stakes as Pierpoint & Co. faces its most volatile market conditions yet, while its employees continue their pathological pursuit of success at any cost.

*Industry* is deliberately uncomfortable viewing — these characters are often reprehensible — but the writing is exceptionally sharp and the performances (particularly Myha'la Herrold and Kit Harrington in later seasons) are extraordinary. Essential for fans of morally complex workplace drama.

- **Episodes**: Season 4 complete
- **Best for**: Succession fans, anyone who liked Billions

## 🏆 All-Time HBO Classics: Essential Viewing

### 5. The Sopranos (1999–2007)

Still the benchmark. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is the New Jersey mob boss and suburban father struggling with panic attacks, his murderous professional obligations, and a dysfunctional family that mirrors his criminal organization.

**The Sopranos** didn't just change television — it defined what prestige drama could be. Gandolfini's performance is one of the greatest in the history of the medium. Every character is drawn with extraordinary complexity; every storyline illuminates something real about family, power, and self-deception.

21 Emmy Awards. Essential.

- **Episodes**: 86 across 6 seasons
- **Best for**: Everyone — start here if you've never watched prestige TV

### 6. Succession (2018–2023)

The Roy family controls a global media empire, and when patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) shows signs of weakness, his children — Kendall, Siobhan, and Roman — begin maneuvering for succession. **Succession** is simultaneously devastating drama and the funniest show on television; the Roy children's insults are as quotable as any comedy.

The final season's last two episodes are among the greatest TV ever made. **Won 13 Emmy Awards** including Best Drama four years running.

- **Episodes**: 39 across 4 seasons
- **Best for**: Corporate drama fans, dark comedy fans, anyone who appreciated The Sopranos

### 7. The Wire (2002–2008)

David Simon's examination of Baltimore — across five seasons covering the drug trade, the port, city government, public schools, and the media — is the most comprehensive portrait of American urban life ever put on television. **The Wire** has no heroes and no villains: only systems, and the humans those systems create and destroy.

It is slow, demanding television that rewards patience with some of the richest storytelling in the medium's history. Frequently cited by TV critics as the greatest television series ever made.

- **Episodes**: 60 across 5 seasons
- **Best for**: Anyone serious about television as an art form

### 8. Game of Thrones (Seasons 1–6)

At its peak, **Game of Thrones** was the most spectacular television ever produced. The first six seasons of the series — George R.R. Martin's adaptation of his epic fantasy novels — are genuinely extraordinary: complex characters, shocking narrative turns, and production values that changed audience expectations for television forever.

The final two seasons' divisive conclusions are well-documented. Watch the first six seasons as some of the greatest TV of the decade; approach the last two with adjusted expectations.

- **Episodes**: 73 across 8 seasons
- **Best for**: Fantasy fans — indispensable even with its flawed finale

---

## 🐉 The Westeros Universe

### 9. House of the Dragon (Seasons 1–2)

The prequel series set 200 years before Game of Thrones, following the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. **House of the Dragon** successfully revived the franchise after Game of Thrones' divisive finale — the political maneuvering, dragon battles, and family drama are all excellent.

Season 2's final episodes are spectacularly scaled and suggest Season 3 will be the series' finest.

- **Episodes**: 18 across 2 seasons
- **Best for**: GoT fans, political fantasy drama enthusiasts

### 10. A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms

*(See #1 above — listed again to complete the Westeros cluster)*

## 🧟 Sci-Fi & Genre

### 11. The Last of Us (Season 1–2)

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey star in HBO's adaptation of Naughty Dog's landmark video game. In a world devastated by a fungal pandemic that transforms infected humans into violent creatures, Joel escorts teenager Ellie — who may be immune — across what remains of America.

**The Last of Us** is the gold standard of video game adaptation. It expands the game's story intelligently, adds new material (the devastating Episode 3 about Bill and Frank is now Emmy-winning television), and delivers performances from Pascal and Ramsey that match or exceed the game's emotional power.

Season 2, adapting *The Last of Us Part II*, is currently on Max.

- **Episodes**: Season 1 complete (9 episodes) + Season 2
- **Best for**: Video game fans, post-apocalyptic drama enthusiasts, anyone who wants prestige sci-fi

### 12. Westworld (Seasons 1–4)

**Westworld** Season 1 is a genuinely mind-bending puzzle box — a luxury theme park populated by human-like androids who begin to achieve consciousness. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy's adaptation of the 1973 film is dense, philosophical, and endlessly inventive in its first two seasons.

Seasons 3 and 4 divide fans significantly (the show was cancelled after Season 4); watch Season 1 as a standalone if you want the purest experience.

- **Episodes**: 36 across 4 seasons
- **Best for**: Sci-fi fans who like their genre TV cerebral and layered

### 13. Primal (Season 3, 2026)

Genndy Tartakovsky's Emmy-winning animated series follows a caveman and a dinosaur who form an unlikely bond. **Primal** is entirely wordless — no dialogue — communicating purely through action and emotion. Season 3 is currently releasing new episodes on Sundays through mid-March.

5 Emmy Awards including Outstanding Animated Program. One of the most distinctive animated series in television history.

- **Best for**: Animation fans, anyone who appreciates visual storytelling

---

## 🎭 Comedy & Satire

### 14. The Righteous Gemstones (Seasons 1–4)

Danny McBride's comedy about a world-famous televangelist family is one of HBO's most consistently funny shows. John Goodman is magnificent as patriarch Eli Gemstone; Edi Patterson and McBride's sibling chemistry drives the best comedic sequences. The series skewers prosperity gospel religion while maintaining genuine affection for its deeply flawed characters.

Often compared to *Succession* for its dysfunctional family dynamics — except *Gemstones* commits fully to comedy and never apologizes for it.

- **Episodes**: Season 4 complete
- **Best for**: Dark comedy fans, fans of Danny McBride's previous work

### 15. Curb Your Enthusiasm (Complete Series)

Larry David's semi-improvised comedy about a fictionalized version of himself navigating Los Angeles ran for 12 seasons and concluded in 2024. **Curb Your Enthusiasm** is one of the great achievements in cringe comedy — Larry's social catastrophes are simultaneously horrifying and cathartic.

The complete series is on Max. The finale is perfect.

- **Episodes**: 120 across 12 seasons
- **Best for**: Seinfeld fans, cringe comedy enthusiasts, anyone who finds social rules interesting

### 16. Barry (Complete Series)

A hitman (Bill Hader) tries to leave his profession behind to become an actor in Los Angeles. **Barry** starts as a dark comedy and gradually transforms into something stranger and more disturbing — by its final season, it's a genuinely harrowing examination of violence and moral responsibility.

Hader won four Emmy Awards for his performance. The show's tonal shifts are unlike anything else on television.

- **Episodes**: 32 across 4 seasons
- **Best for**: Dark comedy fans, character study enthusiasts

---

## 🔍 Crime & Thriller

### 17. The Penguin (2024)

Set in the immediate aftermath of *The Batman* (2022), **The Penguin** follows Colin Farrell's Oswald Cobblepot seizing the power vacuum in Gotham City's criminal underworld. Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone matches Farrell's intensity in every scene.

This is prestige crime drama in superhero clothing — the Batman mythos provides the context, but the show operates as a pure crime thriller about ambition, family loyalty, and the cost of power.

- **Episodes**: 8
- **Best for**: Batman fans, crime drama enthusiasts, fans of The Batman (2022)

### 18. True Detective (Seasons 1 & 4)

**Season 1** of True Detective — Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as Louisiana detectives investigating a series of ritual murders — is one of the finest limited series ever made. Nic Pizzolatto's writing and Cary Fukunaga's direction create sustained dread over eight episodes.

**Season 4: Night Country** (2024) — Jodie Foster and Kali Reis investigate a disappearance at a research station in Ennis, Alaska. Critically acclaimed and tonally distinct from Season 1, it's the best True Detective since the original.

- **Episodes**: 8 per season (watch S1 and S4)
- **Best for**: Crime mystery fans who want atmosphere and character

### 19. Sharp Objects (2018)

Amy Adams plays a journalist returning to her Missouri hometown to cover the murders of two young girls — and confronting her own traumatic past. **Sharp Objects** is slow, oppressive Southern Gothic television that builds to an ending that reframes everything that came before.

Directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, it achieves what rare TV does: it leaves you thinking for days after.

- **Episodes**: 8
- **Best for**: Psychological thriller fans, Amy Adams fans

---

## 🌍 The White Lotus & Anthology Series

### 20. The White Lotus (Seasons 1–3)

**The White Lotus** is one of HBO's defining series of the 2020s — a dark comedy anthology about guests and staff at a luxury resort, with a new location each season.

- **Season 1** (Hawaii): Six Emmy Awards including Outstanding Limited Series
- **Season 2** (Sicily): Won 10 Emmy Awards — Jennifer Coolidge's performance is extraordinary
- **Season 3** (Thailand): Six Golden Globe nominations including Best Drama Series; Walton Goggins, Carrie Coon, and Parker Posey all nominated

Each season is a standalone — you can watch them in any order, though the cumulative effect of watching all three is substantial.

- **Episodes**: 6 per season
- **Best for**: Dark comedy fans, satire of wealth enthusiasts, anyone who wants essential water-cooler TV

---

## 📺 More Must-Watch Max Series

### 21. Euphoria (Seasons 1–2)

Zendaya as a teenage addict navigating high school, relationships, and the complexities of identity. **Euphoria** is as visually striking as any television ever produced — Sam Levinson's direction creates an immersive dreamscape of neon and despair. Zendaya won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in two consecutive years.

Season 3 is in production.

- **Best for**: Drama fans, viewers who want emotionally challenging television

### 22. Insecure (Complete Series)

Issa Rae's comedy-drama about Black women navigating life and love in Los Angeles ran for five seasons. **Insecure** is one of the great comedic achievements of the 2010s — specific, funny, and generous toward its characters even when they make terrible decisions.

- **Episodes**: 40 across 5 seasons
- **Best for**: Comedy drama fans, anyone who wants deeply specific, well-written television

### 23. Six Feet Under (Complete Series)

The Fisher family runs a funeral home in Los Angeles. **Six Feet Under** is one of HBO's most emotionally complete series — each episode opens with a death (a stranger's), and the Fishers' processing of mortality frames their own lives' dramas. The series finale is frequently cited as the greatest in television history.

- **Episodes**: 63 across 5 seasons
- **Best for**: Drama fans willing to invest in a complete story

### 24. Mare of Easttown (2021)

Kate Winslet plays a small-town Pennsylvania detective investigating a murder while her own life falls apart. **Mare of Easttown** is the ideal limited series — seven perfectly paced episodes, exceptional performances, and a mystery that earns its resolution.

Winslet won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress. Deservedly.

- **Episodes**: 7
- **Best for**: Mystery drama fans, anyone who wants a satisfying limited series

### 25. The Bear (FX on Hulu — note streaming)

**Correction**: *The Bear* streams on Hulu (not Max) in the US. We mention it here because it frequently appears on "best of Max" lists by mistake. Jeremy Allen White's chef drama is on Hulu — see our [Netflix vs Hulu guide](/posts/netflix-vs-hulu-2026/) for Hulu's best content.

## 🎬 HBO Documentary Highlights

### 26. Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man! (2024)

Judd Apatow co-directed this two-part documentary about comedy legend Mel Brooks — covering his extraordinary life from 1920s Brooklyn to Blazing Saddles to 2024. **100% on Rotten Tomatoes**. Essential for comedy fans.

### 27. The Jinx (2015) & The Jinx: Part Two (2024)

Robert Durst — heir to a real estate fortune — was connected to multiple murders over decades. **The Jinx** captured one of documentary television's most astonishing moments in its finale. Part Two, released nine years later, follows what happened after.
