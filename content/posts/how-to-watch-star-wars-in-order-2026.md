## Chronological vs Release Order: Which is Better?

Before diving in, let's settle the debate:

### Chronological Order (This Guide)
**Best for**: Rewatches, completionists, fans who want the full in-universe narrative
- Follows events as they happen across time
- See Anakin's rise before Luke's
- Understand references and callbacks in context

### Release Order (1977 → Present)
**Best for**: First-time viewers
- Experience the twist reveals the way fans did in theaters
- "I am your father" lands much harder without prior context
- The saga as George Lucas intended

**Our Recommendation**: First timers → Release order. Everyone else → Chronological.
