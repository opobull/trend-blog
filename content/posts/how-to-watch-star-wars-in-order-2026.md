3. Rogue One → Solo
4. The Force Awakens → The Last Jedi → The Rise of Skywalker
5. Mandalorian → Ahsoka → etc.

Skips Episode I entirely. Maximum narrative impact.

1. A New Hope
2. Empire Strikes Back
3. Attack of the Clones *(Vader origin reveal)*
4. Revenge of the Sith
5. Return of the Jedi

### Path 3: Chronological (This Guide)

## FAQ

### Can I skip the prequels?
Technically yes, but you'll miss Anakin/Vader's full story, which makes Return of the Jedi hit much harder.

### Is The Clone Wars worth watching?
**Absolutely.** Seasons 4-7 are some of the best Star Wars ever made. The Siege of Mandalore (Season 7) runs parallel to Revenge of the Sith and is unmissable.

### Is Andor really that good?
**Yes.** It's the most mature, best-written Star Wars content ever made. Treat it like a prestige drama.

### Do I need to watch Rebels before Ahsoka?
Highly recommended. Key Rebels characters appear in Ahsoka, and their history adds significant emotional weight.

### How long to watch everything?
- Just the films: ~25 hours
- Films + essential Disney+ shows: ~100 hours
- Everything: 200+ hours
