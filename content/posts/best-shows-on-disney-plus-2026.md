Disney+ has become the undisputed home of Star Wars and the MCU — and in 2026, the platform's original series library is stronger than ever. From *Andor* (widely considered the best Star Wars show ever made) to *WandaVision* (still the MCU's most ambitious TV experiment), Disney+ delivers blockbuster-quality storytelling every week.

Whether you're a Star Wars fanatic, Marvel completist, or just looking for great TV, this is every show on Disney+ worth binging right now — ranked by quality, rewatchability, and pure entertainment value.

## The 25 Best Shows on Disney+ Right Now

### 1. Andor (2022–)
**Genre**: Star Wars Drama | **Rating**: 96% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (Season 2 coming 2026)

*Andor* is the best thing to happen to Star Wars since *The Empire Strikes Back*. This is not hyperbole. Tony Gilroy's prequel series about Cassian Andor's transformation into a Rebel spy is a slow-burn political thriller that barely feels like traditional Star Wars — and that's exactly why it's a masterpiece.

Set five years before *Rogue One*, *Andor* follows Diego Luna's Cassian as he's drawn into the Rebellion's earliest days. The show takes its time, trusts its audience, and delivers some of the most mature, sophisticated storytelling in the entire Star Wars canon. The prison arc in episodes 8–11 is television at its absolute peak.

Season 2 is confirmed for 2026 and will cover the four years leading up to *Rogue One*.

**Why it's #1**: *Andor* is five times better than *Rogue One*, according to critics. It's exceptional television that happens to be set in the Star Wars universe — not a "Star Wars show" in the traditional sense.

**Watch if you like**: Political thrillers, slow burns, *The Wire*, *Blade Runner 2049*, shows that treat you like an adult

**Warning**: Not for viewers who need constant lightsaber battles. This is a thinking person's Star Wars.

---

### 2. The Mandalorian (2019–)
**Genre**: Star Wars Western | **Rating**: 93% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3 (Season 4 coming)

The show that launched Disney+ and saved Star Wars. *The Mandalorian* follows a lone bounty hunter (Pedro Pascal) traveling the galaxy with Grogu (Baby Yoda) — the most merchandisable character since Baby Groot.

Season 1 is near-perfect episodic television. Season 2 delivers fan-service bombshells (Ahsoka! Boba Fett! Luke Skywalker!). Season 3 gets messier but still delivers spectacular action. The show works as both a standalone adventure series and connective tissue for the larger Star Wars universe.

Season 4 is in development, with Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni steering the ship.

**Why it's #2**: The most purely entertaining Star Wars show. Accessible to newcomers, rewarding for longtime fans.

**Watch if you like**: Westerns, samurai films, *Lone Wolf and Cub*, episodic adventures, Baby Yoda memes

---

### 3. WandaVision (2021)
**Genre**: Marvel Sitcom-to-Superhero | **Rating**: 91% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (limited series)

The first MCU Disney+ show — and still the best. *WandaVision* starts as a bizarre sitcom pastiche where Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live in a perfect suburban reality modeled after classic TV shows. Each episode mimics a different era (*The Dick Van Dyke Show*, *Bewitched*, *The Brady Bunch*, *Malcolm in the Middle*, etc.).

Then the cracks appear. The mystery deepens. And by the finale, *WandaVision* reveals itself as a heartbreaking meditation on grief, trauma, and the lengths we go to avoid facing loss.

The decision to frame a superhero story as sitcom homages was a masterstroke. *WandaVision* took genuine creative risks, and most of them paid off brilliantly.

**Why it's #3**: The most ambitious MCU show. Elizabeth Olsen delivers a career-best performance.

**Watch if you like**: *The Twilight Zone*, classic sitcoms, psychological thrillers, Scarlet Witch lore

**Note**: *Agatha All Along* (2024) and *Vision Quest* (coming late 2026) continue this story.

---

### 4. Loki (2021–2023)
**Genre**: Marvel Time-Travel Thriller | **Rating**: 92% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 2

After escaping with the Tesseract in *Endgame*, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is captured by the Time Variance Authority — a bureaucratic organization that polices timeline deviations across the multiverse. What follows is a trippy, character-driven exploration of identity, free will, and the nature of time itself.

Season 1 introduced Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino), a female Loki variant, and kicked off the MCU's multiverse saga. Season 2 concluded the series with an emotionally devastating finale that elevated Loki to god-tier status (literally).

Owen Wilson as Mobius is perfect casting. The chemistry between Hiddleston and Di Martino crackles.

**Why it's #4**: The most intellectually ambitious MCU show. Tom Hiddleston's final arc is beautifully earned.

**Watch if you like**: Time-travel stories, multiverse chaos, *Doctor Who*, Tom Hiddleston's cheekbones

---

### 5. The Bear (2022–)
**Genre**: Culinary Drama | **Rating**: 99% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3

Wait — *The Bear* isn't a Disney+ original, it's FX/Hulu. But Disney owns Hulu, and in international markets (UK, Europe, Australia, etc.), *The Bear* streams exclusively on Disney+ as a "Star Original."

If you have access to it on Disney+, watch it immediately. *The Bear* follows Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), a fine-dining chef who returns to Chicago to run his family's struggling sandwich shop. The show is intense, chaotic, and emotionally raw — like *Whiplash* set in a kitchen.

Season 3 premiered in 2024. The show has won multiple Emmys and is widely considered one of the best series on television.

**Why it's #5**: One of the best shows on TV, period. Only here because it's region-locked.

**Watch if you like**: Kitchen chaos, working-class drama, panic attacks, found family

**Note**: US viewers watch on Hulu. International viewers watch on Disney+.

---

### 6. Ahsoka (2023–)
**Genre**: Star Wars Adventure | **Rating**: 86% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (Season 2 coming 2026)

Rosario Dawson stars as Ahsoka Tano, the fan-favorite Jedi introduced in *The Clone Wars* animated series. *Ahsoka* is a direct sequel to *Star Wars Rebels*, following Ahsoka and Sabine Wren (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) as they search for Ezra Bridger and confront Grand Admiral Thrawn.

The show is gorgeous, action-packed, and rewards longtime Star Wars fans with deep lore connections. It's less accessible to newcomers than *The Mandalorian*, but for animated-series fans, it's essential viewing.

Season 2 is confirmed for 2026, with Hayden Christensen returning as Anakin Skywalker.

**Why it's #6**: The most rewarding show for Clone Wars/Rebels fans. Rosario Dawson is perfect casting.

**Watch if you like**: *The Clone Wars*, *Rebels*, lightsaber duels, Jedi lore

**Note**: Watch *Rebels* and *The Clone Wars* first for maximum impact.

---

### 7. X-Men '97 (2024–)
**Genre**: Marvel Animated | **Rating**: 99% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (Season 2 coming 2026)

A direct continuation of *X-Men: The Animated Series* (1992–1997), *X-Men '97* picks up right where the original left off — same timeline, same continuity, same iconic theme song. But the animation is modern, the storytelling is more sophisticated, and the emotional stakes are higher.

Season 1 delivered several gut-punch moments that left longtime X-Men fans in tears. The show respects the original while elevating it to prestige TV standards.

Season 2 is confirmed for 2026.

**Why it's #7**: The most nostalgic Marvel show that's also genuinely great. 99% on Rotten Tomatoes doesn't lie.

**Watch if you like**: The original animated series, X-Men comics, '90s nostalgia, actually good reboots

---

### 8. What If...? (2021–)
**Genre**: Marvel Anthology Animation | **Rating**: 94% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 2 (Season 3 coming)

An animated anthology series exploring alternate MCU timelines: What if Peggy Carter became Captain America? What if Killmonger saved Tony Stark? What if Ultron won?

Some episodes are silly fun, others are genuinely moving. The multiverse format allows Marvel to take creative risks without affecting canon. Season 2 expanded the scope with even weirder scenarios.

Season 3 is expected in 2026.

**Why it's #8**: The most creative Marvel show. Perfect for "what if" theorists.

**Watch if you like**: Anthology series, MCU deep cuts, alternate timelines, animated action

---

### 9. The Book of Boba Fett (2021–2022)
**Genre**: Star Wars Crime Drama | **Rating**: 66% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) takes over Jabba the Hutt's crime empire on Tatooine. The show is uneven — half *Godfather*-style crime drama, half *The Mandalorian* Season 2.5 — but when it works, it's great.

The biggest issue? Episodes 5–6 barely feature Boba at all, instead focusing on Mando and Grogu. Those episodes are fantastic, but they make the show feel like a backdoor *Mandalorian* continuation.

**Why it's #9**: Flawed but fun. The action sequences are spectacular, and Temuera Morrison is excellent.

**Watch if you like**: Bounty hunters, Tatooine, *The Mandalorian*, crime sagas

**Note**: Essentially required viewing between *Mando* Seasons 2 and 3.

---

### 10. Obi-Wan Kenobi (2022)
**Genre**: Star Wars Drama | **Rating**: 82% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (limited series)

Ewan McGregor returns as Obi-Wan, 10 years after *Revenge of the Sith*. The show follows his reluctant return to action when young Leia is kidnapped, forcing him to confront Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) once again.

The Obi-Wan/Vader confrontation in Episode 3 is one of the best Star Wars moments in years. The show has pacing issues and some questionable creative choices, but McGregor and Christensen's performances carry it.

**Why it's #10**: Ewan McGregor. That's it. That's the reason.

**Watch if you like**: Prequel trilogy, Obi-Wan, Darth Vader, emotional lightsaber duels

---

### 11. Moon Knight (2022)
**Genre**: Marvel Psychological Thriller | **Rating**: 86% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Oscar Isaac stars as Marc Spector, a mercenary with dissociative identity disorder who becomes the avatar of the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. *Moon Knight* is Marvel's darkest, weirdest show — part psychological thriller, part supernatural action, part Egyptian mythology deep dive.

Episode 5 is a masterclass in character study. Isaac's dual performance (Marc and Steven) is exceptional. The show was designed as a limited series, but Marvel has hinted at more Moon Knight content.

**Why it's #11**: The most unique MCU show. Oscar Isaac gives two incredible performances in one body.

**Watch if you like**: Psychological thrillers, Egyptian mythology, unreliable narrators, Oscar Isaac

---

### 12. Ms. Marvel (2022)
**Genre**: Marvel Coming-of-Age | **Rating**: 98% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) is a Pakistani-American teenager from Jersey City who discovers she has superpowers. *Ms. Marvel* is the MCU's most joyful, heartfelt show — a love letter to fandom, immigrant families, and teenage self-discovery.

The show has a distinct visual style (comic-book panels, animated flourishes) and genuinely great representation. Iman Vellani is a star.

Kamala went on to appear in *The Marvels* (2023 film), and Season 2 is rumored but unconfirmed.

**Why it's #12**: The most wholesome MCU show. Perfect for younger viewers and adults who want to feel good.

**Watch if you like**: Coming-of-age stories, representation, Spider-Man: Homecoming, teen heroes

---

### 13. She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022)
**Genre**: Marvel Legal Comedy | **Rating**: 77% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) is a lawyer who becomes She-Hulk after a blood transfusion from her cousin Bruce Banner. The show is a half-hour legal comedy with superhero cameos, fourth-wall breaks, and a self-aware sense of humor.

*She-Hulk* is divisive — some love its sitcom format and meta humor, others found it uneven. But Maslany is excellent, and when the show leans into comedy, it's genuinely funny.

**Why it's #13**: The funniest MCU show. Tatiana Maslany deserved better marketing.

**Watch if you like**: Legal comedies, fourth-wall breaks, *Ally McBeal*, Daredevil cameos

---

### 14. Hawkeye (2021)
**Genre**: Marvel Holiday Action-Comedy | **Rating**: 92% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) teams up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld) to take down the Tracksuit Mafia during Christmas in New York. *Hawkeye* is a breezy, fun holiday action series with great chemistry between Renner and Steinfeld.

The show introduced Echo (Alaqua Cox), who got her own spin-off series in 2024.

**Why it's #14**: The best Marvel Christmas special. Hailee Steinfeld steals every scene.

**Watch if you like**: Christmas action movies, *Die Hard*, Kate Bishop, street-level heroes

---

### 15. The Falcon and The Winter Soldier (2021)
**Genre**: Marvel Action Thriller | **Rating**: 89% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) grapples with taking up the Captain America shield while teaming up with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) to stop a terrorist group. The show tackles race, legacy, and what it means to be Captain America in modern America.

It's more conventional than *WandaVision* or *Loki*, but the action is great and the character work is strong. Sam's arc from Falcon to Captain America is beautifully handled.

**Why it's #15**: The most grounded MCU show. Anthony Mackie's speech in the finale is powerful.

**Watch if you like**: Political thrillers, buddy-cop dynamics, Captain America lore

---

### 16. Secret Invasion (2023)
**Genre**: Marvel Spy Thriller | **Rating**: 53% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) returns to Earth to stop a Skrull invasion. The show aimed to be a paranoid spy thriller in the vein of *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* — but the execution fell flat for most viewers.

The biggest issue? The Skrull shapeshifting threat never feels genuinely dangerous, and major plot points are resolved off-screen. Still, Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn (Talos) give strong performances.

**Why it's #16**: Disappointing but not unwatchable. Samuel L. Jackson is always watchable.

**Watch if you like**: Nick Fury, Skrulls, spy thrillers (with tempered expectations)

---

### 17. Echo (2024)
**Genre**: Marvel Crime Drama | **Rating**: 70% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), introduced in *Hawkeye*, returns to her hometown to confront her past and reconnect with her Native American roots. *Echo* is Marvel's first TV-MA rated show, with grittier violence and a smaller-scale story.

The show is a mixed bag — some episodes work beautifully, others drag. But Alaqua Cox's performance and the Native representation are commendable.

**Why it's #17**: The most ground-level MCU show. Important for representation.

**Watch if you like**: Street-level Marvel, *Hawkeye*, Native American stories, Daredevil (he cameos)

---

### 18. Percy Jackson and the Olympians (2023–)
**Genre**: Fantasy Adventure | **Rating**: 92% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (Season 2 coming 2026)

A faithful adaptation of Rick Riordan's beloved novels. Percy Jackson (Walker Scobell) discovers he's the son of Poseidon and must prevent a war between the Greek gods.

The show is a vast improvement over the maligned 2010s films. Riordan is heavily involved, and the kid actors are excellent. Season 2 (*The Sea of Monsters*) is confirmed for 2026.

**Why it's #18**: The adaptation fans deserved. Perfect for families and fantasy lovers.

**Watch if you like**: *Harry Potter*, Greek mythology, YA fantasy, Rick Riordan books

---

### 19. Star Wars: The Bad Batch (2021–2024)
**Genre**: Star Wars Animated | **Rating**: 95% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3

A sequel to *The Clone Wars*, following Clone Force 99 — a team of defective clones with unique abilities — as they navigate the transition from the Republic to the Empire.

*The Bad Batch* concluded with Season 3 in 2024, delivering an emotionally satisfying finale. It's essential viewing for *Clone Wars* fans.

**Why it's #19**: The best Star Wars animated show since *The Clone Wars*. Great character arcs.

**Watch if you like**: *The Clone Wars*, clone troopers, Star Wars lore, animated action

---

### 20. Bluey (2018–)
**Genre**: Kids Animation | **Rating**: 100% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3

An Australian animated series about a Blue Heeler puppy named Bluey and her family. *Bluey* is ostensibly a kids' show — but adults love it just as much. The show is wholesome, funny, and surprisingly profound about parenting, imagination, and childhood.

*Bluey* is the most-watched show on Disney+ in multiple regions, beating Star Wars and Marvel in viewership.

**Why it's #20**: The best kids' show on Disney+. Adults will cry. Yes, really.

The longest-running American sitcom in history. All 35+ seasons are available on Disney+, making it the ultimate comfort-watch library.

Seasons 3–10 are considered the golden age. Modern seasons are hit-or-miss, but there are still great episodes scattered throughout.

**Why it's #21**: Cultural institution. Endless rewatchability.

**Watch if you like**: Classic sitcoms, animation, satirical comedy, nostalgia

**Start with**: Seasons 4–8 if you've never watched.

### 22. The Clone Wars (2008–2020)
**Genre**: Star Wars Animated | **Rating**: 93% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 7

Set between *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith*, *The Clone Wars* expands the prequel era with hundreds of episodes exploring the Clone War. What starts as a kids' show evolves into essential Star Wars storytelling.

The final season (2020) is some of the best Star Wars content ever made. Dave Filoni's masterwork.

**Why it's #22**: Essential Star Wars viewing. Makes the prequels better in retrospect.

**Watch if you like**: Star Wars lore, Ahsoka Tano, clone troopers, animated action

**Note**: Use a watch guide — some arcs are skippable.

Set between *Revenge of the Sith* and *A New Hope*, *Rebels* follows the Ghost crew — a ragtag group of rebels fighting the Empire. The show starts light but becomes essential viewing by Season 2.

Grand Admiral Thrawn (introduced in Season 3) is one of Star Wars' best villains. The finale is perfect.

**Why it's #23**: The most underrated Star Wars show. Essential before watching *Ahsoka*.

**Watch if you like**: Star Wars, found family, underdog stories, Dave Filoni

---

### 24. Agatha All Along (2024)
**Genre**: Marvel Dark Comedy | **Rating**: 81% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1

Agatha Harkness (Kathryn Hahn) from *WandaVision* gets her own series following a coven of witches down the Witches' Road. The show is campy, witchy fun with great musical numbers.

It's not essential MCU viewing, but Kathryn Hahn is fantastic and the show embraces its weirdness.

**Why it's #24**: Kathryn Hahn chewing scenery for 9 episodes. Witchy vibes.

**Watch if you like**: *WandaVision*, witches, camp, Kathryn Hahn

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best show on Disney+ right now?

**Andor** is the highest-rated Disney+ original (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and widely considered the best Star Wars show ever made. For Marvel, **WandaVision** and **Loki** are tied for best.

### Do I need to watch Disney+ shows to understand MCU movies?

Increasingly, yes. *WandaVision* is required before *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*. *Loki* is essential for understanding the multiverse. *Ms. Marvel* introduces Kamala Khan before *The Marvels*.

Disney+ shows are no longer "side content" — they're integral to the MCU.

### Is The Mandalorian over?

No. Season 4 is in development. The show is also getting a movie directed by Dave Filoni that will tie together *The Mandalorian*, *Ahsoka*, and *The Book of Boba Fett*.

### What happened to the Star Wars movie plans?

Disney shifted focus to Disney+ shows after *Solo* underperformed in 2018. Multiple Star Wars films are in development (Rey sequel, Dawn of the Jedi, James Mangold's origin story), but release dates keep shifting.

### Can I watch Star Wars shows without watching the animated series?

*The Mandalorian* and *Andor* are completely standalone. *Ahsoka* requires watching *Rebels* and *The Clone Wars* for full context. *The Book of Boba Fett* benefits from knowing his backstory, but it's not essential.
