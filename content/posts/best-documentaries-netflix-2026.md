## New Netflix Documentaries in 2026

Features Elizabeth's own testimony, exclusive family interviews, and investigator accounts. **100% on Rotten Tomatoes.**

A gripping true-crime documentary examining the case of British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby, convicted of murdering seven babies between 2015 and 2016.

## The 30 Best Netflix Documentaries — Ranked

## 🔪 True Crime

True crime is Netflix's documentary superpower. These are the best:

### 1. Making a Murderer (2015) — Series

The documentary that launched the true crime streaming era. Steven Avery spent 18 years imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit — and was exonerated through DNA evidence. Two years later, while suing Manitowoc County for $36 million, he was arrested again for the murder of Teresa Halbach.

Directors Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos spent 10 years filming this case. The result is one of the most compelling and disturbing examinations of the American justice system ever made. The question of whether Avery was framed a second time remains genuinely unresolved.

- **Episodes**: 10 (+ Part 2: 10 more)
- **Best for**: Anyone interested in justice, law enforcement, wrongful convictions

### 2. The Keepers (2017) — Series

Seven episodes investigating the 1969 murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik, a nun in Baltimore — and the wider cover-up that may have enabled it. *The Keepers* starts as a cold-case mystery and slowly expands into something far more disturbing: allegations of systematic abuse at a Catholic school and the institutional protection of perpetrators.

Meticulously researched and deeply upsetting. The amateur investigators at the center of the film are remarkable people.

- **Episodes**: 7
- **Best for**: True crime fans who want depth and investigative rigor

### 3. Icarus (2017) — Film

Bryan Fogel set out to make a *Super Size Me*-style documentary about performance-enhancing drugs in amateur cycling — and accidentally stumbled into one of the biggest scandals in sports history.

When his contact, Russian scientist Grigory Rodchenkov, suddenly becomes the central figure in Russia's state-sponsored Olympic doping program, the film transforms from personal experiment into international thriller. Fogel essentially became a key figure in the story he was documenting. **Won the Academy Award for Best Documentary.**

- **Length**: 121 minutes
- **Best for**: Sports fans, political intrigue enthusiasts, anyone who followed the Russian Olympic doping scandal

### 4. The Investigation of Lucy Letby (2026) — Film

One of the most disturbing and important true-crime documentaries of the decade. The story of Lucy Letby — a trusted neonatal nurse who systematically harmed and killed babies in her care — raises deeply uncomfortable questions about institutional blindness and the psychology of evil in professional environments.

- **Best for**: True crime fans, healthcare professionals, anyone who wants to understand how such crimes go undetected

### 5. Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart (2026) — Film

The definitive account of a case that gripped America in 2002. Elizabeth Smart's testimony gives the film an authority and emotional weight that previous accounts lacked.

- **Best for**: Cold case true crime fans

### 6. Fyre (2019) — Film

The definitive account of the Fyre Festival catastrophe. Thousands of people paid thousands of dollars for a luxury music festival in the Bahamas and arrived to disaster relief tents and cheese sandwiches. The machinations of Billy McFarland and his associates, the social media manipulation, and the human cost to Bahamian workers make this essential viewing.

Netflix and Hulu both made Fyre Festival documentaries simultaneously (Hulu's *Fyre Fraud* is also worth watching). Netflix's version has better access to footage and production values.

- **Length**: 97 minutes
- **Best for**: Anyone interested in social media culture, fraud, influencer marketing

### 7. Don't F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer (2019) — Series

A three-part documentary about online vigilantes who tracked a cat killer whose videos spread across the internet — and discovered something far worse. The investigation eventually connects to an international murder case.

Deeply uncomfortable viewing that raises real questions about internet vigilantism, the mechanisms of infamy, and how killers use attention. Compulsively watchable despite (because of?) its disturbing subject matter.

- **Episodes**: 3
- **Best for**: True crime fans interested in internet culture and online investigation

---

## 🌿 Nature & Science

### 8. A Gorilla Story (2026) — Film

David Attenborough's latest narrated nature documentary follows baby gorilla Pablo's journey to adulthood in Rwanda's Virunga Mountains. Features remarkable footage of gorilla social dynamics, conflict, and family bonds never previously captured on film.

At 100 years old, Attenborough remains the definitive voice of natural history documentary. This may be among his final projects — treat it accordingly.

- **Best for**: Nature lovers, Attenborough fans, families

### 9. Our Planet (2019) — Series

Attenborough again, but on a planetary scale. Netflix's flagship nature documentary series examines Earth's ecosystems — from frozen worlds to jungles to the open ocean — with stunning 4K cinematography and an urgent environmental message.

*Our Planet II* (2023) is also available and covers animal migration with similarly extraordinary footage.

- **Episodes**: 8 (+ Our Planet II: 4 episodes)
- **Best for**: Nature documentary fans, anyone who loved Planet Earth

### 10. My Octopus Teacher (2020) — Film

Craig Foster spent a year free-diving daily in a South African kelp forest and formed an unexpected relationship with a wild octopus. What sounds like an odd premise becomes a genuinely moving meditation on connection, nature, and what it means to pay attention.

**Won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.** One of Netflix's most beloved original documentaries.

- **Length**: 85 minutes
- **Best for**: Nature lovers, anyone who wants something genuinely life-affirming

### 11. Seaspiracy (2021) — Film

A controversial but compelling investigation into the fishing industry's environmental impact. Director Ali Tabrizi travels the world documenting overfishing, ocean plastic, and the systemic forces that make sustainable seafood nearly impossible.

Some claims have been disputed by scientists; others are undeniable. Whatever your conclusions, Seaspiracy raises important questions about food systems and environmental destruction.

- **Length**: 89 minutes
- **Best for**: Environmental documentary fans, food sustainability interest

## 🏅 Sports

### 12. Untold (2021–2026) — Series

### 14. Break Point (2023) — Series

Netflix's tennis equivalent to *Drive to Survive* — behind-the-scenes access to professional tennis players across the tour season. Covers both ATP and WTA players, capturing the pressure, travel, and sacrifice of professional tennis.

- **Episodes**: 10
- **Best for**: Tennis fans, sports documentary fans who enjoyed Drive to Survive

### 15. Sunderland 'Til I Die (2018) — Series

The remarkable story of Sunderland AFC's back-to-back relegations from the English Premier League and Championship. The access is extraordinary — boardroom meetings, manager firings, training ground crises — and the human stories of players, staff, and fans are genuinely moving.

- **Episodes**: 8 (3 seasons)
- **Best for**: Football fans, sports documentary fans who want character depth

- **Best for**: Sports fans, Michael Jordan fans, anyone interested in excellence and obsession

### 18. Stutz (2022) — Film
