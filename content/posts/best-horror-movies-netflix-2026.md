## Part 1: Extremely Scary (🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪)

### 1. Incantation (2022)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Country**: Taiwan | **Rating**: NR

The scariest film on this list — and one of the most frightening found-footage films ever made. **Incantation** follows a mother who broke a religious taboo six years ago and must now protect her daughter from the curse that followed. The film is shot documentary-style and frequently breaks the fourth wall, pulling you directly into its ritualistic horror.

What makes it so effective is the cultural specificity — the horror is rooted in Taiwanese folk religion and feels genuinely alien and unknowable. Many viewers report feeling deeply unsettled long after the credits roll.

- **Director**: Kevin Ko
- **Best for**: Found footage fans, supernatural horror enthusiasts
- **Warning**: Genuinely disturbing; not recommended for anxious viewers

### 2. Hereditary (2018)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Ari Aster's debut film is one of the most acclaimed horror movies of the past decade — and one of the most psychologically devastating. Following the Graham family after the death of their secretive grandmother, **Hereditary** builds unbearable dread before unleashing chaos in ways you won't see coming.

Toni Collette's performance is one of the greatest in horror history — raw, terrifying, and heartbreaking simultaneously. The film works on multiple levels: as supernatural horror, as grief drama, and as a nightmare about family legacy.

- **Director**: Ari Aster
- **Best for**: Viewers who want horror that genuinely disturbs rather than just startles
- **Warning**: Extremely upsetting imagery; deals with child death and severe grief

### 3. Midsommar (2019)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R (Director's Cut: R)

Ari Aster's follow-up to Hereditary is almost the opposite — a horror film set entirely in broad Scandinavian daylight. American graduate students travel to a Swedish midsummer festival that turns increasingly sinister. **Midsommar** is a slow, beautiful, deeply unsettling film about grief, toxic relationships, and folk horror.

What's remarkable is how much dread Aster generates in sunny meadows and bright communal halls. By the film's extraordinary finale, you'll feel you've experienced something genuinely strange.

- **Director**: Ari Aster
- **Best for**: Art house horror fans, viewers who appreciated Hereditary
- **Warning**: Graphic violence and disturbing rituals; not traditional horror

---

## Part 2: Very Scary (🔪🔪🔪🔪)

### 4. Smile (2022)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

One of the most effective mainstream horror films in years. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) witnesses a patient's traumatic suicide and begins experiencing a haunting curse that manifests as unsettling smiling figures. **Smile** is relentless in its tension-building and genuinely lands its jump scares — which is rarer than you'd think.

The smile imagery is simple but brilliantly deployed. A person with a wrong, fixed smile standing in the corner of a scene is one of horror's great recent images. Smile 2 (2024) is also available on Netflix.

- **Director**: Parker Finn
- **Best for**: Mainstream horror fans, jump scare enthusiasts

### 5. Don't Move (2024)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

A Netflix Original produced by Sam Raimi. **Don't Move** follows a grieving woman (Kelsey Asbille) who, after a chance encounter in an isolated forest, is injected by a stranger with a paralytic drug. She has roughly 20 minutes before her entire body shuts down — and must run, hide, and fight for her life.

The premise sounds pulpy, but the execution is taut and deeply effective. The physiological horror of feeling your body slowly stop responding is something the film exploits brilliantly.

- **Director**: Brian Netto, Adam Schindler
- **Best for**: Survival thriller fans, viewers who liked A Quiet Place

### 6. Sinister (2012)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

True crime writer Ellison Oswald (Ethan Hawke) moves his family into a house where a murder occurred — and discovers a box of Super 8 home movies in the attic showing the murders of multiple families, stretching back decades. **Sinister** is the movie that launched Mr. Boogie and remains one of the scariest mainstream horror films of the 2010s.

The Super 8 footage sequences are genuinely disturbing, and the film's atmosphere is relentlessly oppressive. Ethan Hawke carries the film with a performance that grounds the supernatural in recognizable human weakness.

- **Director**: Scott Derrickson
- **Best for**: Supernatural horror fans, found footage adjacent scares

### 7. Gerald's Game (2017)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Stephen King's "unfilmable" novel, brought to life by Mike Flanagan (The Haunting of Hill House). Jessie (Carla Gugino) is left handcuffed to a bed frame in a remote lake house after her husband dies unexpectedly. What follows is a masterclass in psychological horror — Jessie must confront her trauma, her hallucinations, and a very real intruder while unable to move.

Flanagan's direction is exceptional, keeping a single-location story gripping for its full runtime. The climax involves one of the most viscerally unpleasant things you'll see in a horror film.

- **Director**: Mike Flanagan
- **Best for**: Stephen King fans, psychological horror enthusiasts

### 8. His House (2020)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

A Netflix Original that flew under many radars. South Sudanese refugees Bol and Rial escape war-torn South Sudan and are resettled in a crumbling English council flat. But something in the house is wrong — and the horror that follows is deeply tied to the trauma and guilt they've carried from their homeland.

**His House** is exceptional horror filmmaking — frightening on a surface level, but profound in its examination of survivor's guilt, displacement, and the weight of memory. One of the best horror films of 2020.

- **Director**: Remi Weekes
- **Best for**: Horror fans who want depth alongside their scares

### 9. Train to Busan (2016)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: Not Rated

The finest zombie film of the 21st century, and one of the best action films too. A father and daughter board a train from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse breaks out across South Korea. What follows is a perfectly paced, emotionally devastating thrill ride.

**Train to Busan** works because you actually care about the characters. The zombie sequences are spectacular and relentless, but the emotional beats land just as hard. The finale will destroy you.

- **Director**: Yeon Sang-ho
- **Best for**: Anyone — this is essential viewing regardless of horror preference

### 10. #Alive (2020)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

Korean zombie horror with a distinctly modern angle. **#Alive** focuses on a gamer trapped alone in his apartment during a zombie outbreak — unable to leave, running out of food, watching his battery die. The isolation and depression are as frightening as the zombies, and the film's understanding of how people actually behave (obsessively checking social media, waiting for official communication) makes it feel eerily plausible.

A companion piece to Train to Busan in many ways, but with a very different intimate scale.

- **Director**: Cho Il-hyung
- **Best for**: Korean horror fans, fans of isolation horror

---

## Part 3: Legitimately Scary (🔪🔪🔪)

### 11. Don't Breathe (2016)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Three thieves break into the home of a blind war veteran, expecting an easy score. They were very wrong. **Don't Breathe** is pure nerve-wracking tension — an almost entirely silent film that uses darkness, sound design, and exceptional staging to create unbearable suspense.

The film has a twist that many viewers find deeply disturbing, and it genuinely subverts expectations of who the "villain" is. A masterclass in sustained tension.

- **Director**: Fede Álvarez
- **Best for**: Thriller fans who want visceral intensity without supernatural elements

### 12. The Witch (2015)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Set in 1630s New England, **The Witch** follows a Puritan family exiled from their plantation to a remote farm on the edge of a dark forest. One by one, terrible things begin to happen. Robert Eggers' debut feature is a period horror masterpiece — methodical, atmospheric, and genuinely unsettling.

The film uses authentic 17th century dialogue and was shot largely with natural light. It's less about jump scares and more about the creeping dread of isolation, religious paranoia, and something dark watching from the trees.

- **Director**: Robert Eggers
- **Best for**: Art house horror, slow-burn atmosphere fans

### 13. Fear Street: Part 1 — 1994 (2021)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Netflix's slasher trilogy based on R.L. Stine's *Fear Street* books is a love letter to 1990s horror. Part 1 is set in 1994 Shadyside, where a group of teenagers discovers a connection between the town's serial killer legends and an ancient witch's curse. **Fear Street** is self-aware, fast-paced, and genuinely fun — with real gore and genuine stakes.

All three parts of the trilogy are available: 1994, 1978, and 1666. Watch them in order for the full story.

- **Director**: Leigh Janiak
- **Best for**: Slasher fans, horror nostalgia (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer vibes)

### 14. Cam (2018)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

A Netflix Original that deserves far more attention. **Cam** follows camgirl Alice (Madeline Brewer) who discovers her live stream account has been taken over by a perfect doppelgänger — one who looks exactly like her but isn't her. The psychological horror of identity theft and digital existence is explored with real intelligence.

The film was written by a former camgirl and treats its protagonist and her work with unusual respect, making the horror more personal and effective than you'd expect.

- **Director**: Daniel Goldhaber
- **Best for**: Psychological horror fans, viewers who want something original

### 15. Annihilation (2018)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Technically science fiction, but **Annihilation** generates more pure dread than most horror films. A team of scientists enters "The Shimmer" — an expanding environmental disaster zone — and encounters increasingly disturbing phenomena. Alex Garland's film is strange, visually arresting, and deeply unsettling.

The lighthouse sequence alone is one of the most genuinely disturbing things committed to film in recent years. This is cerebral horror at its finest.

- **Director**: Alex Garland
- **Best for**: Sci-fi horror fans, viewers who like Lovecraftian cosmic dread

### 16. Insidious (2010)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: PG-13

The film that launched a franchise, **Insidious** remains one of the most effective PG-13 horror films ever made. When young Dalton Lambert falls into a mysterious coma and demonic presences begin haunting their home, his parents must delve into the dark realm called The Further to save him.

James Wan's direction is impeccable — the film understands how to build atmosphere and land a scare without relying on gore. The Further sequences are genuinely creepy.

- **Director**: James Wan
- **Best for**: Supernatural horror fans, jump scare lovers who want craft alongside the scares

### 17. Frankenstein (2025)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited take on Mary Shelley's classic, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, Jacob Elordi as the Creature, and Christoph Waltz as Dr. Pretorius. Del Toro brings his signature visual grandeur and genuine love for classic monster mythology to one of literature's most enduring stories.

This is a lush, operatic horror film that's as interested in tragedy as in terror. Elordi's performance as the Creature is the emotional center.

- **Director**: Guillermo del Toro
- **Best for**: Classic horror fans, del Toro enthusiasts (Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak)

---

## Part 4: Creepy & Atmospheric (🔪🔪)

### 18. The Haunting of Bly Manor (2020)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

Mike Flanagan's follow-up to The Haunting of Hill House is more melancholy than terrifying, but "Bly Manor" has genuine ghost imagery and an achingly sad finale. A young American governess takes care of two orphaned children in a sprawling English estate — and the manor's history begins to reveal itself.

More romantic ghost story than horror, but the ghost hiding-in-plain-sight sequences are some of the most clever scares Flanagan has ever devised.

- **Director**: Mike Flanagan
- **Best for**: Viewers who want atmosphere and emotion alongside their scares

### 19. Apostle (2018)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

Set in 1905, **Apostle** follows a man who infiltrates a religious cult on a remote island to rescue his kidnapped sister. What he discovers goes far beyond the cult's surface-level fanaticism. Gareth Evans (The Raid) brings his kinetic action sensibility to folk horror with genuinely unsettling results.

This is a slow burn that earns its horrifying finale. The imagery in the third act is deeply uncomfortable.

- **Director**: Gareth Evans
- **Best for**: Folk horror fans, viewers who want period-set horror with action elements

### 20. Veronica (2017)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

Based on a true Spanish case, **Veronica** follows a teenage girl in 1991 Madrid who attempts to contact her deceased father using a Ouija board during a solar eclipse — with catastrophic results. Paco Plaza (REC) brings the same found-footage sensibility to a more conventional supernatural horror format.

The teenage domestic setting gives the film a claustrophobic intimacy, and the finale is genuinely frightening.

- **Director**: Paco Plaza
- **Best for**: Supernatural horror fans, Spanish language horror

### 21. The Platform (2019)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: TV-MA

More science fiction than horror, but **The Platform** generates the kind of sustained dread that horror fans live for. In a vertical prison where food descends on a platform from the top floors to the bottom — and is thoroughly consumed before it reaches lower floors — a man tries to survive and understand the system.

Spanish-language allegory about class, capitalism, and human nature that's viscerally disturbing even when it's not explicitly violent.

- **Director**: Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia
- **Best for**: Fans of social horror, dystopian fiction with bite

### 22. A Quiet Place Part II (2021)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: PG-13

The Abbott family ventures beyond their home after the events of the first film, encountering both new threats and, perhaps, other survivors. **A Quiet Place Part II** expands the world while maintaining the suffocating tension of John Krasinski's original. Cillian Murphy is excellent as a survivor who's given up on people.

- **Director**: John Krasinski
- **Best for**: Fans of the first film, tension-based horror (both A Quiet Place films are on Netflix)

## Part 5: Accessible Horror (🔪)

### 23. Enola Holmes (2020) — Not Horror

We mention this to say: if you've had enough scares, Netflix has plenty of excellent non-horror content too. But for accessible lighter horror:

### 23. Army of the Dead (2021)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪 | **Rating**: R

Zack Snyder's zombie heist film is more action movie than horror, but it earns a place on this list. Following a group of mercenaries who plan a casino heist in zombie-overrun Las Vegas, it's big, loud, occasionally gory, and enormous fun.

- **Director**: Zack Snyder
- **Best for**: Action fans who want zombies without existential dread

### 24. #Manhole (2023)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: NR

A Japanese survival horror thriller about a man who falls into a manhole on the night before his wedding and must use only his smartphone to survive. Clever, claustrophobic, and genuinely suspenseful.

- **Director**: Kazuyoshi Kumakiri
- **Best for**: Japanese cinema fans, claustrophobic survival thriller fans

### 25. Doctor Sleep (2019)

**Scare Factor**: 🔪🔪 | **Rating**: R

Mike Flanagan's sequel to The Shining follows an adult Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) as he helps a young girl with powerful psychic abilities evade a group of supernatural beings who feed on "steam" — the essence released when people with the shining die in terror.

The True Knot make for compelling villains, Rebecca Ferguson is mesmerizing as Rose the Hat, and the finale is a genuine reunion with the Overlook Hotel.

- **Director**: Mike Flanagan
- **Best for**: Shining fans, Mike Flanagan completionists
