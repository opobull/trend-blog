## Real Madrid's Situation

Real Madrid enters this match under a cloud after their shocking 5-4 defeat to Benfica in the Champions League, which cost them direct qualification to the Round of 16. The loss has sparked unrest among fans at the Bernabéu, with boos expected during today's match.

Manager Álvaro Arbeloa has kept clean sheets in his first two LaLiga matches in charge and will look to become the second Real Madrid manager this century to go three games without conceding in LaLiga (after Rafa Benítez).
