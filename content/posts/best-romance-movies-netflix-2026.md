## 🆕 New Netflix Romances in 2026

### 1. People We Meet on Vacation (2026)

Based on Emily Henry's bestselling novel — the author whose *Beach Read* and *Book Lovers* have become Hollywood staples — **People We Meet on Vacation** follows Poppy (Emily Bader) and Alex (Tom Blyth), who have been best friends for a decade despite having nothing in common. Every summer they take a vacation together; after a falling-out two years ago, they attempt one more trip to fix their friendship — and discover what everyone around them already knows.

Emily Henry's novels have a devoted readership, and this adaptation has been eagerly anticipated. Blyth (who played the young Snow in *The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes*) brings exactly the right energy to the reluctant, emotionally guarded Alex.

- **Best for**: Emily Henry fans, friends-to-lovers romance enthusiasts, beach read fans

### 2. Office Romance (2026)

**Jennifer Lopez** and **Brett Goldstein** (*Ted Lasso*'s Roy Kent) as two workaholics who begin a secret office romance with entirely predictable and entirely enjoyable consequences. A raunchy ensemble rom-com with Betty Gilpin, Amy Sedaris, and Tony Hale filling out the supporting cast.

Lopez returning to rom-com — the genre that made her a star (*The Wedding Planner*, *Maid in Manhattan*) — with a sharper, more adult edge. Goldstein's deadpan intensity against Lopez's warmth is exactly the chemistry this kind of film needs.

- **Best for**: Jennifer Lopez fans, workplace comedy romance fans, fans of Ted Lasso's Roy Kent energy

### 3. Saturn Return (2026)

A Chicago-set romance examining what happens in the decade between the idealism of college romance and the complicated reality of adult relationships. **Saturn Return** — named for the astrological concept of the Saturn "return" around age 29–30 when life's choices become permanent — tackles themes rarely explored in rom-com: not falling in love, but figuring out what kind of love you actually want.

- **Best for**: Viewers in their late 20s/early 30s, character-driven romance fans

### 4. Wuthering Heights (2026)

Emerald Fennell (*Saltburn*, *Promising Young Woman*) directs **Margot Robbie** as Cathy and **Jacob Elordi** as Heathcliff in an adaptation of Emily Brontë's gothic romance. This is not a safe, heritage-drama interpretation — Fennell's track record suggests something genuinely unsettling and provocative.

Whether it's in theaters or available on streaming by the time you read this, it's one of 2026's most discussed films. Elordi — who has become the defining romantic lead of his generation (*Saltburn*, *Priscilla*, *The Kissing Booth*) — is ideally cast as Heathcliff.

- **Best for**: Gothic romance fans, Brontë fans, anyone who trusts Emerald Fennell

## 😂 Best Romantic Comedies on Netflix

### 5. Set It Up (2018)

The gold standard of Netflix Original rom-coms and still the best. **Zoey Deutch** and **Glen Powell** play overworked assistants who scheme to set up their respective bosses — only to fall for each other in the process. The chemistry between Deutch and Powell predates their much-publicized real-life closeness during *Anyone But You*, and it's electric throughout.

**92% on Rotten Tomatoes.** Funny, warm, and smarter about workplace dynamics than the premise suggests.

- **Starring**: Zoey Deutch, Glen Powell, Lucy Liu, Taye Diggs
- **Runtime**: 105 minutes
- **Best for**: Anyone who wants a genuinely good modern rom-com

### 6. Always Be My Maybe (2019)

Childhood sweethearts Sasha (Ali Wong) and Marcus (Randall Park) grew apart as adults — Sasha became a celebrity chef, Marcus became a musician who never left their San Francisco neighborhood. When they reconnect 15 years later, the sparks are complicated by how differently their lives have turned out.

**89% on Rotten Tomatoes.** The film belongs entirely to Wong and Park, who co-wrote the script with Michael Golamco — the comedy feels lived-in because it's informed by their actual friendship. Keanu Reeves appears as himself in a cameo that may be the funniest three minutes of any rom-com this decade.

- **Starring**: Ali Wong, Randall Park, Keanu Reeves
- **Runtime**: 101 minutes
- **Best for**: Romantic comedy fans, Asian-American representation seekers

### 7. The Perfect Find (2023)

**Gabrielle Union** as Jenna, a fashion editor making a professional comeback who falls for a handsome younger man — who turns out to be her new boss's son. **The Perfect Find** is exactly the high-concept workplace romance it promises to be, elevated considerably by Union's undeniable charm and genuine comedic ability.

- **Starring**: Gabrielle Union, Keith Powers
- **Runtime**: 99 minutes
- **Best for**: Workplace romance fans, Gabrielle Union fans

### 8. Holidate (2020)

Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey as two strangers who agree to be each other's "holidates" — plus-ones for every holiday to deflect family pressure — throughout an entire year. The setup is clever, the execution is warm, and the holiday-to-holiday structure gives the film natural momentum.

- **Starring**: Emma Roberts, Luke Bracey
- **Runtime**: 104 minutes
- **Best for**: Holiday romance fans, easy weekend viewing

### 9. The Half of It (2020)

A shy, academically brilliant teenager helps a sweet but inarticulate jock write love letters to the girl they both love — but the film's truest romance is something more unexpected. **The Half of It** is one of Netflix's most quietly lovely originals — wise about love, identity, and what it means to truly know someone.

**97% on Rotten Tomatoes.**

- **Director**: Alice Wu
- **Runtime**: 104 minutes
- **Best for**: Coming-of-age romance fans, viewers who want something more literary than typical rom-com

### 10. Someone Great (2019)

On the eve of a major career move, Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) processes a devastating breakup with one last New York City adventure alongside her two best friends. **Someone Great** is the rom-com about the end of relationships — about grief, and friendship as the love that sustains you.

Funny, specific, and genuinely moving in its final act.

- **Starring**: Gina Rodriguez, DeWanda Wise, Brittany Snow
- **Runtime**: 92 minutes
- **Best for**: Women navigating their late 20s/30s, friendship comedy fans

## 💕 Emotional & Sweeping Romances

### 11. Our Souls at Night (2017)

Based on Kent Haruf's final novel, **Our Souls at Night** stars Robert Redford and Jane Fonda as two widowed neighbors who begin spending nights together — not for passion initially, but for companionship. What develops between them is genuinely moving: the film is about the particular tenderness of late-life love.

Redford and Fonda's fourth onscreen pairing (*Barefoot in the Park*, *The Electric Horseman*, *The Chase*) is their finest. A reminder that the best romances aren't always between young people.

- **Starring**: Robert Redford, Jane Fonda
- **Runtime**: 103 minutes
- **Best for**: Mature viewers, anyone who wants romance without youth as a prerequisite

### 12. The Notebook (2004)

Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in the defining modern love story. Young Noah and Allie fall in love across class lines in 1940s South Carolina; the film frames their story through elderly Noah reading to his wife from a notebook.

**The Notebook** understands exactly what it is and executes it with total commitment. The rain scene remains one of cinema's most imitated romantic images for a reason.

- **Starring**: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams
- **Runtime**: 123 minutes
- **Best for**: Classic romantic drama fans, a guaranteed cry

### 13. Before Sunrise (1995)

Richard Linklater's masterpiece of conversation-as-romance. American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets French student Céline (Julie Delpy) on a train and they spend a single night walking and talking through Vienna, knowing they'll never meet again.

**Before Sunrise** is one of the most romantic films ever made — not because of what happens, but because of what's said. The sequels (**Before Sunset**, **Before Midnight**) continue the story across decades; all three are among the finest films about relationships in cinema.

- **Starring**: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy
- **Runtime**: 101 minutes
- **Best for**: Intellectually inclined romance fans, viewers who want a film that captures the electricity of real conversation

### 14. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)

Joel (Jim Carrey) discovers that his ex-girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their relationship erased, and undergoes the same procedure — only to find himself trying to preserve those memories from within the erasure. Michel Gondry's visually inventive science fiction romance is one of the best films about heartbreak ever made.

**Won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.** Not traditionally romantic — but perhaps the most honest film about love's complications on this list.

- **Starring**: Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet
- **Runtime**: 108 minutes
- **Best for**: Romantic film connoisseurs, anyone who's experienced a significant relationship ending

## 🌏 Korean Romance on Netflix

Korean cinema and television have produced some of the most emotionally powerful romances in recent decades. Netflix has an excellent selection:

### 15. 20th Century Girl (2022)

Set in 1999 South Korea, this teenage romance follows Na Bo-ra, who promises to spy on her best friend's crush while her friend is studying abroad — only to fall for his best friend instead. **20th Century Girl** is gentle, nostalgic, and genuinely heartfelt.

The 1999 setting (no smartphones, dial-up internet, disposable cameras) gives the film a particular ache — the impossibility of connection at a distance before the internet made it easy.

- **Best for**: Korean romance fans, coming-of-age romance enthusiasts, viewers who loved *My Mister* or *Reply 1988*

### 16. My Love from the Star (Korean Series)

An alien who has lived on Earth for 400 years falls in love with a famous actress in the weeks before he must return to his planet. One of the most beloved K-dramas ever made — a fantasy romance that became a global phenomenon.

## 📚 Literary Adaptations & Period Romance

### 17. Pride and Prejudice (2005)

Joe Wright's film adaptation of Jane Austen's novel — with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy — is the definitive film version of the story. The cinematography (Roger Deakins) is extraordinary, and Macfadyen's Darcy ("you have bewitched me body and soul") remains one of cinema's great romantic performances.

- **Runtime**: 129 minutes
- **Best for**: Jane Austen fans, period romance enthusiasts, anyone who needs a benchmark for what film romance can be

### 18. Sense and Sensibility (1995)

Emma Thompson's Academy Award-winning screenplay adaptation of Austen's other great romance. Elinor (Thompson) and Marianne (Kate Winslet) Dashwood navigate love and economic precarity in 18th-century England. Ang Lee directs; Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon is perfectly cast.

- **Runtime**: 136 minutes
- **Best for**: Austen fans, period romance enthusiasts

### 19. Little Women (2019)

Greta Gerwig's luminous adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel. Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, and Emma Watson as the March sisters; Timothée Chalamet as Laurie; Meryl Streep as Aunt March. The film's non-linear structure illuminates the novel's themes with fresh clarity.

**Won the Oscar for Best Costume Design; nominated for Best Picture.**

- **Runtime**: 135 minutes
- **Best for**: Alcott fans, anyone who wants romance embedded in a story about ambition and art

---

## 🎄 Holiday Romance

### 20. The Holiday (2006)

Two women — one in England, one in Los Angeles — swap homes for the Christmas holidays and both find unexpected romance. **The Holiday** is the definitive modern Christmas romantic comedy: Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are both excellent, the English cottage is impossibly perfect, and Jack Black is genuinely charming as a potential love interest.

- **Starring**: Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black
- **Runtime**: 138 minutes
- **Best for**: Christmas viewing, anyone who wants comfort and romance simultaneously

### 21. A Christmas Prince (2017) & Sequels

A journalist travels to a fictional European kingdom to cover a prince, falls for him instead, and ultimately becomes a queen. **A Christmas Prince** is Netflix's most self-aware holiday romance — not particularly sophisticated, but enormously charming and endlessly rewatchable. Three films and a spinoff are available.

- **Best for**: Holiday viewing, undemanding comfort romance

---

## 💔 Teen Romance

### 22. To All the Boys I've Loved Before (Trilogy)

Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) has always kept her love letters private — until they're accidentally mailed to every boy she's ever had a crush on. **Peter Kavinsky** (Noah Centineo) becomes the fake boyfriend who becomes the real thing. The trilogy follows their relationship across high school and into college.

Netflix's most successful YA romance trilogy. Lana Condor and Noah Centineo have genuine chemistry, and the first film in particular is exactly what a teen romance should be.

- **Runtime**: ~100 min per film
- **Best for**: Teenagers, anyone who wants uncomplicated sweet romance

### 23. The Kissing Booth (Trilogy)

Elle Evans (Joey King) has been best friends with Lee Flynn her whole life — and strictly forbidden from dating his older brother Noah (Jacob Elordi). **The Kissing Booth** trilogy is Netflix's most-watched teen romance series by a significant margin.

Not sophisticated viewing, but tremendous fun for its target audience.

- **Best for**: Teen viewers, Jacob Elordi fans
