DC's cinematic landscape in 2026 is more complex — and more exciting — than ever. You have the completed DCEU (DC Extended Universe), James Gunn's brand-new DCU launching with Superman, Matt Reeves' standalone Batman universe, and Todd Phillips' Joker films all running in parallel.

This guide cuts through the confusion. We'll show you exactly **how to watch DC movies in order** — whether you want chronological story order, release date order, or just the best films to start with.

Just finished the Marvel movies? Our [MCU watch order guide](/posts/how-to-watch-mcu-in-order-2026/) covers all 33+ Marvel films in order.

## Understanding DC's Multiple Universes (2026)

Unlike Marvel's relatively unified MCU, DC currently has **three separate cinematic universes** running simultaneously:

| Universe | Status | Key Films |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **DCEU** (Snyder/WB era) | Complete — 15 films | Man of Steel through Aquaman 2 |
| **DCU** (James Gunn's reboot) | Just launched | Superman (2025), Clayface (2026) |
| **Elseworlds** (standalone films) | Ongoing | The Batman, Joker |

**The bottom line**: You can watch these universes completely independently of each other. The DCEU is finished and self-contained. The new DCU is just beginning. Elseworlds films like The Batman exist in their own timelines.

---

## Option 1: DCEU in Release Date Order (Recommended for First-Timers)

If you've never watched the DCEU and want to experience it as audiences originally did, **release date order** is the best approach. The films were designed to be watched this way, and you'll get each new hero introduced in the proper context.

### Complete DCEU Release Date Order

**1. Man of Steel (2013)**
The film that launched the DCEU. Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent discovering his alien origins and becoming Superman, while General Zod (Michael Shannon) threatens Earth. Zack Snyder's darker, more grounded take on Superman divided fans but established the universe's tone.
- **Stream on**: Max

**2. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)**
Set 18 months after Man of Steel, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) witnesses the destruction of Metropolis and declares Superman a threat. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) makes her DCEU debut. The theatrical cut is 2.5 hours; the Ultimate Edition (3 hours) fills in significant plot gaps — watch the Ultimate Edition if possible.
- **Stream on**: Max

**3. Suicide Squad (2016)**
Amanda Waller assembles a team of supervillains for black ops missions in exchange for reduced sentences. Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn are standouts. The film has significant flaws but remains entertaining.
- **Stream on**: Max

**4. Wonder Woman (2017)**
The DCEU's creative high point. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) leaves Themyscira during World War I and discovers the horrors of human conflict. Patty Jenkins' direction is exceptional, and the No Man's Land sequence remains one of the best superhero movie moments ever.
- **Stream on**: Max

**5. Justice League (2017) / Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021)**
Batman assembles Earth's heroes to fight Steppenwolf. The theatrical version was heavily recut from Snyder's vision. **Zack Snyder's Justice League** (4 hours, on Max) is the definitive version — more character development, better villain, and a complete story. Watch the Snyder Cut.
- **Stream on**: Max (both versions)

**6. Aquaman (2018)**
Jason Momoa's Arthur Curry discovers his royal Atlantean heritage and must claim the throne to prevent war between Atlantis and the surface world. James Wan directs a visually spectacular underwater epic that became the highest-grossing DCEU film.
- **Stream on**: Max

**7. Shazam! (2019)**
Teenager Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is granted superpowers by an ancient wizard — transforming into the adult superhero Shazam (Zachary Levi) whenever he says the magic word. The lightest, funniest entry in the DCEU. A great family-friendly option.
- **Stream on**: Max

**8. Birds of Prey (2020)**
Following her breakup with the Joker, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) forms an unlikely alliance with other Gotham women. An underrated action comedy with inventive fight sequences and genuine personality.
- **Stream on**: Max

**9. Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)**
Set in Cold War 1984, Diana faces Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) and Cheetah (Kristen Wiig). Less successful than the original but has its passionate defenders. Essential if you're watching the full DCEU.
- **Stream on**: Max | Prime Video

**10. The Suicide Squad (2021)**
James Gunn's reboot/sequel is everything the first film wasn't — violent, weird, funny, and surprisingly emotional. A group of expendable supervillains is sent to a remote island to destroy a secret installation. Idris Elba, John Cena, and Margot Robbie are all excellent.
- **Stream on**: Max

**11. Black Adam (2022)**
Dwayne Johnson finally brings ancient Egyptian anti-hero Black Adam to the screen after years of development. The Justice Society makes their debut. The post-credits scene featuring a returning Henry Cavill raised enormous expectations that weren't fulfilled.
- **Stream on**: Max

**12. Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)**
Billy Batson and his foster siblings face daughters of Atlas seeking to reclaim the power of the gods. A fun but slight sequel that sadly marked the franchise's end in the DCEU.
- **Stream on**: Max

**13. The Flash (2023)**
Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) travels back in time to prevent his mother's murder, fracturing the multiverse. Features two different versions of Batman (both Affleck and Michael Keaton) and Sasha Calle as Supergirl. A flawed but genuinely ambitious multiverse story.
- **Stream on**: Netflix | Max

**14. Blue Beetle (2023)**
Mexican-American teenager Jaime Reyes bonds with an alien scarab that grants him a powerful exo-suit. A fresh, family-friendly origin story that leaned into its Latino heritage. Xolo Maridueña is excellent.
- **Stream on**: Max

**15. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023)**
Arthur Curry faces Black Manta, now wielding an ancient weapon that threatens to alter the world. The DCEU's final film — a serviceable conclusion to a universe that ended with more potential than achievements.
- **Stream on**: Max

## Option 2: DCEU Chronological Story Order

If you want to experience the DCEU in the order events actually happen within the story, here's the chronological sequence:

| # | Film | Setting |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | Wonder Woman (2017) | 1918 (WWI) |
| 2 | Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) | 1984 |
| 3 | Man of Steel (2013) | Present |
| 4 | Batman v Superman (2016) | Present + 18 months after MoS |
| 5 | Suicide Squad (2016) | Present |
| 6 | Justice League (2017/2021) | Present |
| 7 | Aquaman (2018) | Present |
| 8 | Shazam! (2019) | Present |
| 9 | Birds of Prey (2020) | Present |
| 10 | The Suicide Squad (2021) | Present |
| 11 | Black Adam (2022) | Present |
| 12 | Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023) | Present |
| 13 | The Flash (2023) | Present / Multiverse |
| 14 | Blue Beetle (2023) | Present |
| 15 | Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) | Present |

**Note**: From Man of Steel onwards, most films are set in "present day" and happen in roughly the same timeframe. Chronological order mainly matters for the Wonder Woman films at the start of the list.

## The Elseworlds: Standalone DC Films

These films exist **outside both the DCEU and DCU** — they're completely standalone stories with no connections to other DC films.

### The Dark Knight Trilogy (Christopher Nolan)

The gold standard of superhero filmmaking. Watch these completely independently of everything else.

**1. Batman Begins (2005)**
Bruce Wayne's origin story, from the death of his parents through his training with the League of Shadows and return to Gotham. Christian Bale's Batman is methodical, obsessive, and deeply human.
- **Stream on**: Max

**2. The Dark Knight (2008)**
Widely considered the greatest superhero film ever made. Heath Ledger's Joker is one of cinema's all-time great villains. The battle of wills between Batman and the Joker examines chaos, order, and the cost of heroism with genuine moral complexity.
- **Stream on**: Max

**3. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)**
Eight years after The Dark Knight, Bane (Tom Hardy) arrives in Gotham with a plan to finish what Ra's al Ghul started. A fitting if overly ambitious conclusion to Nolan's trilogy.
- **Stream on**: Max

### The Batman Universe (Matt Reeves)

**The Batman (2022)**
Robert Pattinson as a younger, darker Bruce Wayne — two years into his career as Batman, operating more as a detective than a superhero. The film is a noir mystery wrapped in superhero iconography, running nearly three hours. Colin Farrell's Penguin is transformative.
- **Stream on**: Max

**The Penguin (2024 — Series)**
Set immediately after The Batman, this Max series follows Colin Farrell's Oz Cobb (the Penguin) as he seizes power in Gotham's criminal underworld. Essential viewing between The Batman and its sequel.
- **Stream on**: Max

**The Batman Part II (2026)**
Matt Reeves' sequel is one of the most anticipated films of 2026, releasing October 2. Pattinson returns as Batman facing new threats in Gotham.
- **Stream on**: Theatrical (2026), Max (later)

### Joker Universe

**Joker (2019)**
Todd Phillips' character study of Arthur Fleck, a failed comedian who descends into madness and becomes the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix won the Oscar for Best Actor. Deeply uncomfortable, psychologically complex, and deliberately ambiguous about what's real.
- **Stream on**: Max

**Joker: Folie à Deux (2024)**
Arthur Fleck awaits trial in Arkham State Hospital and falls in love with Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga). A musical that deliberately confounded audience expectations — divisive but fascinating.
- **Stream on**: Max

---

## James Gunn's New DCU: Chapter One — Gods and Monsters

This is where DC's future lies. James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Peter Safran are rebooting DC from scratch with a coherent long-term plan similar to what Kevin Feige did with Marvel.

**The new DCU starts fresh** — you don't need to have seen any DCEU films to enjoy it.

### Released DCU Films

**Superman (2025)**
David Corenswet takes over from Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman. Gunn wrote and directed this reboot, which focuses on Superman as an ideal of optimism and heroism rather than the darker Snyder interpretation. Nicholas Hoult plays Lex Luthor. Rachel Brosnahan is Lois Lane.

The film has been praised for capturing the spirit of the character in a way the DCEU films didn't quite achieve. This is the starting point for the new DC Universe.
- **Stream on**: Max

### Upcoming DCU Films (2026)

**Clayface (September 21, 2026)**
An adaptation of the shapeshifting DC villain, directed by James Mangold. Little else is confirmed, but Mangold (Logan, Ford v Ferrari, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) is an exceptional choice.

### Confirmed DCU Projects

- *Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow* — Milly Alcock as Kara Zor-El in an adaptation of Tom King's acclaimed comic
- *Creature Commandos* (animated series, on Max) — already released, introduces several DCU characters
- *Lanterns* (Max series) — Hal Jordan and John Stewart as space cops investigating a mystery on Earth
- *Paradise Lost* (Max series) — set on Themyscira before Wonder Woman
- *Peacemaker Season 2* (Max series) — John Cena's character bridges DCEU and DCU

## DC vs Marvel: How Do They Compare?

**Marvel's approach**: Tightly interconnected universe with mandatory viewing order for full comprehension. Longer planning horizon, more consistency across films.

**DC's approach (post-Gunn)**: Taking cues from Marvel but allowing for more standalone stories (Elseworlds). More tonal variety — from the grimdark Snyder era to Gunn's colorful optimism.

**Which to watch first?** If you're new to superhero films: start with **The Dark Knight** (standalone, no prerequisites) or **Wonder Woman 2017** (the best DCEU entry). The full MCU watch order requires more commitment upfront.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What order should I watch DC movies in for the first time?**
We recommend **release date order** for the DCEU (Man of Steel through Aquaman 2), followed by standalone Elseworlds films like The Batman and Joker. For new viewers, starting with The Dark Knight Trilogy is also a great option since it requires no prerequisites.

**Do I need to watch the DCEU before the new DCU?**
No — James Gunn's DCU (starting with Superman 2025) is a complete reboot. You can start fresh without watching any DCEU films.

**Is Zack Snyder's Justice League on Netflix?**
No — Zack Snyder's Justice League (the 4-hour director's cut) is on Max. The original theatrical Justice League is also on Max.

**What's the difference between DCEU and DCU?**
The **DCEU** (DC Extended Universe) ran from 2013–2023 under Warner Bros., featuring Henry Cavill as Superman and Ben Affleck as Batman. The **DCU** (DC Universe) is James Gunn's complete reboot launched in 2025, with new actors and a fresh continuity.

**Where can I watch DC movies for free?**
Max offers a subscription with all DC films. Some titles are available with Prime Video add-ons. There's no reliable free legal option, but Max frequently offers promotional pricing for new subscribers.

**Should I watch the Snyder Cut or theatrical Justice League?**
**Zack Snyder's Justice League** (2021) — the 4-hour director's cut — is the superior version by a wide margin. It has better characterization, a complete story, and a superior villain. The theatrical version feels like a different, lesser film.

Netflix has a limited selection of DC films — most notably **The Flash** (2023). The vast majority of DC content is exclusively on Max.
