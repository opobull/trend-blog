## What Happened

Pakistan has won its first T20 match against Australia in eight years, securing a dominant series victory at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The series served as both teams' final preparation before the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, starting February 7, 2026.

The home side's spin quartet proved too much for an under-strength Australian team missing several key players ahead of the World Cup.

## First Match Results

Pakistan claimed a comfortable 22-run victory in the series opener on January 29, 2026.

| Team | Score |
|------|-------|
| Pakistan | 168/8 |
| Australia | 146/8 |

### Key Performances

**Pakistan Batting:**
- Saim Ayub: 40 runs (22 balls) - Featured trademark no-look boundaries over fine leg
- Salman Ali Agha: 39 runs - Including four sixes and one boundary

**Pakistan Bowling (Spin Quartet):**
- Abrar Ahmed: 2/10 (4 overs) - Best bowling figures
- Saim Ayub: 2 wickets - Including Travis Head
- Shadab Khan: Contributed to restricting Australia
- Mohammad Nawaz: Part of the 6-wicket spin attack

**Australia:**
- Cameron Green: 36 runs (top scorer)
- Xavier Bartlett: 34 not out
- Adam Zampa: 4/24 - Strong bowling despite loss

## Australia's Depleted Squad

Australia rested five World Cup players for the series and benched captain Mitchell Marsh. The match saw international debuts for:
- Matt Renshaw
- Jack Edwards
- Mahli Beardman

Travis Head served as stand-in captain, scoring 23 off 13 balls before being dismissed by Ayub.

## Series Context

"It was a great game," Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said after the first match. "I felt 170 was enough on this pitch because our spin bowling is outstanding."

The slow Gaddafi Stadium pitch heavily favored spin bowling, with Head acknowledging: "The conditions made it difficult."

Pakistan went on to clinch the series with a commanding 90-run victory in the second match.

## What's Next

Both teams will travel to Sri Lanka for the T20 World Cup, which begins February 7, 2026. Pakistan's full-strength squad, featuring Babar Azam and returning pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi (recovered from a knee ligament injury), will look to carry this momentum into the tournament.

| Event | Date | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| Pakistan vs Australia T20 Series | Jan 29-Feb 2, 2026 | Lahore, Pakistan |
| T20 World Cup | Feb 7, 2026 | Sri Lanka |
