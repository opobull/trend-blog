Netflix and Hulu have been battling for streaming dominance for over a decade. In 2026, both services have matured into very different animals — and knowing which one is right for you could save you money (or help you justify keeping both).

This is the **honest, detailed Netflix vs Hulu breakdown** you need. We'll cover pricing, content, originals, live TV, device support, and exactly which type of viewer should choose which service.

---

## The Short Answer

- **Choose Netflix** if you want the biggest original content library, international shows, and a seamless global streaming experience
- **Choose Hulu** if you want current network TV (next-day episodes), live TV options, or the Disney/ESPN bundle
- **Choose both** if budget allows — they genuinely complement each other

Now let's get into the details.

---

## Pricing: Netflix vs Hulu in 2026

Streaming prices have continued to rise in 2026 as platforms push subscribers toward higher tiers. Here's where both services stand:

### Netflix Plans (2026)

| Plan | Price/Month | Ads | Resolution | Screens |
|------|------------|-----|------------|---------|
| Standard with Ads | $8.99 | Yes | 1080p | 2 |
| Standard | $15.49 | No | 1080p | 2 |
| Premium | $22.99 | No | 4K HDR | 4 |

Netflix's ad-supported tier has improved significantly — the ad load is lower than competitors, and the content library is nearly identical to ad-free tiers (with a small number of licensing exceptions).

**Note**: Netflix has also continued expanding its **Extra Member** feature, allowing subscribers to add additional members outside their household for an extra fee per month (varies by plan).

### Hulu Plans (2026)

| Plan | Price/Month | Ads | Resolution | Live TV |
|------|------------|-----|------------|---------|
| Hulu (with Ads) | $7.99 | Yes | 1080p | No |
| Hulu (No Ads) | $18.00 | No | 1080p | No |
| Hulu + Live TV (with Ads) | $82.99 | Yes | 1080p | Yes (90+ channels) |
| Hulu + Live TV (No Ads) | $95.99 | No | 1080p | Yes (90+ channels) |

Hulu's on-demand plans are competitively priced — especially the ad-supported entry tier. However, the no-ads jump from $7.99 to $18.00 is steep.

### Bundle Value: Hulu + Disney+ + ESPN+

Hulu's biggest pricing advantage is the **Disney Bundle**:

- **Duo Basic** (Hulu with Ads + Disney+ with Ads): ~$10.99/month
- **Duo Premium** (Hulu No Ads + Disney+ No Ads): ~$19.99/month
- **Trio Basic** (all three with Ads): ~$16.99/month
- **Trio Premium** (all three No Ads): ~$29.99/month

If you want Disney+ anyway, Hulu becomes significantly cheaper through the bundle. Netflix offers no equivalent bundle deal.

### Winner: Hulu (on base price and bundle value)

Hulu's $7.99 entry tier is cheaper than Netflix's $8.99, and the Disney Bundle makes Hulu much better value for households that want multiple services.

## Content Library: What Do You Actually Get?

### Netflix Content Library

Netflix has the larger overall library — approximately **5,000+ titles** (films and series combined) in the US. Key strengths:

**Netflix Originals** are the main draw. The platform spends billions annually on original content, producing some of the most-watched TV events of recent years:
- *Squid Game* (global phenomenon, Season 2 released 2024)
- *Stranger Things* (final season in 2025)
- *Wednesday* (massive hit)
- *The Crown*, *Ozark*, *Bridgerton*, *The Diplomat*
- *Lupin*, *Dark*, *Money Heist* (international originals)

Netflix is also the **leader in international content** — K-dramas, Spanish thrillers, French mysteries, and anime. If you want to explore global television, Netflix is by far the best platform.

**Movies on Netflix**: A large rotating catalog of films, though major theatrical releases tend to arrive later than some competitors. Netflix's original films (*The Irishman*, *Marriage Story*, *Don't Look Up*, *Knives Out* sequels) are a real draw.

### Hulu Content Library

Hulu has approximately **2,500+ titles** but its value proposition is fundamentally different:

**Current network TV** is Hulu's killer feature. Hulu has deals with ABC, NBC, Fox, and other major networks to carry new episodes **the day after they air**. If you want to watch *Abbott Elementary*, *Grey's Anatomy*, *9-1-1*, or other current network shows without a cable subscription, Hulu is your only on-demand option.

**FX on Hulu** is genuinely excellent. FX content — *The Bear*, *Shōgun*, *What We Do in the Shadows*, *Atlanta* — is exclusively available on Hulu (outside of linear TV). This alone is a strong reason to subscribe.

**Hulu Originals** are smaller in volume but hit above their weight:
- *The Handmaid's Tale* (Emmy-winning drama)
- *Only Murders in the Building* (massive hit)
- *The Great* (critically acclaimed dark comedy)
- *Mike*, *Pam & Tommy* (true story dramas)

**Movies on Hulu**: Decent catalog with some premium additions, but movies are generally not Hulu's strength.

### Winner: Netflix (on volume and originals), Hulu (on current TV)

Netflix wins on sheer library size and original content prestige. Hulu wins if current network television and FX programming matter to you.

## Originals: Best Shows on Each Platform

### Must-Watch Netflix Originals in 2026

**Drama**:
- *Squid Game* — Season 2 dropped in 2024; the Korean survival thriller remains Netflix's most-watched show ever
- *The Diplomat* — critically acclaimed political thriller with Keri Russell
- *Ozark* — complete run, one of the best crime dramas of the past decade
- *The Crown* — complete run covering the British Royal Family

**Sci-Fi/Thriller**:
- *Stranger Things* — complete series available after the final season
- *Black Mirror* — anthology series with sharp, often disturbing tech satire
- *Dark* — German sci-fi thriller considered one of the best shows ever made

**Comedy**:
- *Arrested Development* (classic seasons)
- *The IT Crowd* (UK comedy classic)
- *Big Mouth* — crude but genuinely insightful animated comedy

**International**:
- *Money Heist* — Spanish heist thriller with global popularity
- *Lupin* — French mystery series starring Omar Sy
- *All of Us Are Dead* — Korean zombie thriller

### Must-Watch Hulu Originals in 2026

**Drama**:
- *The Bear* — the chef drama that won basically every Emmy it was nominated for
- *Shōgun* — epic historical drama, one of the best series of 2024
- *The Handmaid's Tale* — complete run of the dystopian drama
- *Only Murders in the Building* — perfect blend of mystery and comedy

**Comedy**:
- *Abbott Elementary* — the best network sitcom in years (also airs on ABC)
- *The Great* — Catherine the Great dark comedy, sharply written
- *What We Do in the Shadows* — vampire mockumentary, consistently funny

**True Crime/Drama**:
- *The Dropout* — Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes; riveting
- *Pam & Tommy* — tabloid history done right

### Winner: Tie (different strengths)

Netflix wins on volume and international prestige originals. Hulu wins on prestige drama (*The Bear*, *Shōgun*) and FX content.

---

## Live TV: A Major Hulu Advantage

This is where Hulu clearly wins.

**Hulu + Live TV** gives you access to **90+ channels** including:
- Local networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox) with DVR
- Cable news (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC)
- Sports (ESPN, ESPN2, Fox Sports)
- Entertainment (HGTV, Food Network, TLC)
- Kids (Disney Channel, Cartoon Network)

For cord-cutters who miss live TV, this is a compelling package — especially since it includes Disney+ and ESPN+.

**Netflix** has experimented with live events (the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul boxing match in 2024, live sports events) but has no traditional live TV offering. Netflix live events are occasional rather than a consistent feature.

### Winner: Hulu (by a wide margin)

If live TV matters to you at all, Hulu + Live TV is the obvious choice. Netflix simply doesn't offer this.

## Streaming Quality & Technical Features

### Video Quality

| Feature | Netflix | Hulu |
|---------|---------|------|
| 4K HDR | Yes (Premium plan) | Limited titles |
| 1080p | All plans | All plans |
| Dolby Vision | Yes (Premium) | Limited |
| Dolby Atmos | Yes (Premium) | Limited |
| Download offline | Yes | Yes (No Ads plan) |
| Simultaneous streams | 2-4 (by plan) | 2 (unlimited on Live TV) |

Netflix's **Premium plan** is the better choice for home theater enthusiasts — 4K HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos on supported titles is genuinely impressive. Hulu's 4K content is more limited.

### Interface & Ease of Use

Both platforms have refined their interfaces significantly:

**Netflix**: Clean, recommendation-heavy interface. The autoplay previews are divisive (you can disable them). Search is excellent. The "Continue Watching" row is prominent and useful.

**Netflix Downloads**: Works extremely well on mobile — you can download shows and movies for offline viewing on most plans.

**Hulu**: Interface is slightly more cluttered, balancing on-demand content with live TV options. Can feel overwhelming with add-ons. Search is good but not as fast as Netflix.

**Hulu Downloads**: Available on the No Ads plan only, which is a significant restriction — Netflix allows downloads on all paid plans.

### Winner: Netflix (better quality ceiling and downloads)

---

## Device Support

Both services support essentially all major streaming devices:

| Device | Netflix | Hulu |
|--------|---------|------|
| Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, etc.) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Apple TV | ✅ | ✅ |
| Roku | ✅ | ✅ |
| Amazon Fire TV | ✅ | ✅ |
| PlayStation 5/4 | ✅ | ✅ |
| Xbox | ✅ | ✅ |
| iOS / Android | ✅ | ✅ |
| Web browser | ✅ | ✅ |
| Chromecast / Google TV | ✅ | ✅ |

No meaningful difference here — both run on everything.

### Winner: Tie

---

## Parental Controls & Profiles

**Netflix**: Excellent profile management. You can create a dedicated Kids profile with strict content restrictions. PIN-protect adult profiles. Per-profile viewing history. Netflix's "Netflix Kids" mode is genuinely robust.

**Hulu**: Good parental controls but slightly less refined than Netflix. Kids profiles available. Content rating filters work well.

### Winner: Netflix (marginally better implementation)

---

## International Availability

**Netflix**: Available in 190+ countries. The library varies by region (what's available in the US may not be in Germany, etc.), but the platform itself is global.

**Hulu**: Available **only in the United States** (and US military bases abroad). If you travel internationally or live outside the US, Hulu is not an option.

### Winner: Netflix (decisively)

---

## Who Should Choose Netflix?

**Netflix is the better choice if you:**
- Want the most original content with the biggest budgets
- Watch international shows (K-dramas, anime, European series)
- Travel internationally and need a service that works globally
- Want the best 4K/HDR streaming quality (Premium plan)
- Prefer movies and don't care about current network TV
- Want the easiest, most polished streaming experience

**Best Netflix value**: Standard with Ads at $8.99/month if you can tolerate occasional ads. Premium at $22.99 if you want 4K and multiple screens.

---

## Who Should Choose Hulu?

**Hulu is the better choice if you:**
- Watch current network TV (ABC, NBC, Fox shows the day after they air)
- Want FX content (*The Bear*, *Shōgun*, *Only Murders*)
- Want to cut the cord but keep live TV (Hulu + Live TV)
- Already subscribe to Disney+ and want the bundle discount
- Are on a tight budget and the $7.99 entry price matters
- Live in the US and primarily watch US content

**Best Hulu value**: The Disney Bundle Trio Basic (~$16.99/month for Hulu + Disney+ + ESPN+) if you want multiple services. Hulu standalone at $7.99 if you just want cheap current-TV access.

---

## Should You Subscribe to Both?

If budget allows, **yes — they genuinely complement each other**.

Here's why the combination works:
- Netflix covers originals, international content, and film
- Hulu covers current network TV and FX programming
- Together, you get almost everything on television

Combined cost with both at their cheapest (ad-supported) tiers: ~$16.98/month. That's less than one Premium Netflix plan alone, and you get dramatically more content.

Alternatively: rotate between them. Binge everything you want on one, cancel, subscribe to the other for a few months, repeat.
