## 2. A24 Drops Terrifying Second Trailer for "undertone" - "The Scariest Movie You'll Ever Hear"

A24 has released the second trailer for **undertone**, a psychological horror film already being called "unrelentingly scary" and a frontrunner for the 2026 horror crown. The film arrives in theaters on **March 13, 2026**.

Written and directed by debut filmmaker **Ian Tuason**, undertone follows **Evy** (Nina Kiri from The Handmaid's Tale), who co-hosts a supernatural podcast with friend **Justin** (Adam DiMarco from The White Lotus). After moving home to care for her dying mother, Evy investigates supposed paranormal activity and accidentally opens a door to demonic forces.

**Key Information:**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Studio | A24 |
| Release Date | March 13, 2026 |
| Director | Ian Tuason (debut) |
| Stars | Nina Kiri, Adam DiMarco |
| Budget | $500,000 |

The film's unique hook: **sound as the primary horror driver**. Evy picks up low-level audio frequencies in recordings that reveal supernatural whispers. Critics are already comparing it to Brian De Palma's Blow Out and praising Nina Kiri's essentially solo performance.

Following its Sundance 2026 premiere, Tuason has been tapped to **revitalize the Paranormal Activity franchise** for Atomic Monster and Blumhouse. Collider's early review suggests undertone should be considered for the **Best Sound Oscar** at the 2027 Academy Awards.

## 3. Netflix Unveils "War Machine" Trailer - Alan Ritchson Battles Alien Mech

Netflix has released the first trailer for **War Machine**, a sci-fi action film starring Reacher's **Alan Ritchson** as a U.S. Army Ranger facing an extraterrestrial threat. The film premieres globally on **March 6, 2026**.

Directed by **Patrick Hughes** (The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Expendables 3), War Machine blends military realism with alien invasion action. The trailer showcases Ritchson's character leading soldiers against a massive alien mechanical threat.

**Key Information:**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Platform | Netflix |
| Release Date | March 6, 2026 |
| Director | Patrick Hughes |
| Lead | Alan Ritchson |
| Genre | Sci-Fi Action |

**Cast:** Alan Ritchson, Dennis Quaid, Stephan James, Jai Courtney, Esai Morales, Keiynan Lonsdale, Daniel Webber

The film incorporates the brutal realism of U.S. Army Ranger School—its 61-day program of sleep deprivation and 20+ mile ruck marches—into an intense alien combat scenario. Quaid plays a general supporting the operation while staying "clean" compared to Ritchson's mud-covered frontline character.

Netflix is positioning War Machine as one of its biggest action releases of 2026, capitalizing on Ritchson's massive popularity from the Reacher series.
