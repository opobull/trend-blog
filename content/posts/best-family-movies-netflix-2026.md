### The Wild Robot (2026)
DreamWorks' acclaimed animated film based on Peter Brown's beloved novel arrives on Netflix. A shipwrecked robot (Roz) washes ashore on a wild island and must adapt to survive — eventually adopting a baby gosling named Brightbill.

### Cosmic Princess Kaguya!
A modern anime musical reimagining of a classic Japanese folktale (*The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter*). A high schooler's life is upended when Kaguya — a rapidly aging baby from the moon — crashes into her world. Charming and visually inventive.

## 🎬 For All Ages: Family Classics

### 1. Night at the Museum (2006)

The new night watchman at New York's Museum of Natural History discovers that the exhibits come alive after dark — including a T-Rex skeleton, Easter Island statues, Roman centurions, and a miniature civilization featuring cowboy Owen Wilson and Roman soldier Steve Carell.

**Night at the Museum** has been a family movie night staple for nearly 20 years for good reason: the premise never gets old, Ben Stiller's chaos-management is endlessly watchable, and there's always something happening on screen. The sequels (*Battle of the Smithsonian*, *Secret of the Tomb*) are also on Netflix.

- **Age**: 6+
- **Runtime**: 108 minutes
- **Best for**: First museum visit prep, kids who love history or dinosaurs

### 2. Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)

Robin Williams plays a devoted father who, after a messy divorce, disguises himself as a British nanny to spend time with his children. **Mrs. Doubtfire** is one of Williams' warmest performances — genuinely funny, occasionally touching, and built on the kind of physical comedy that transcends generations.

Modern families note that the film's premise (deception as an expression of love) sparks interesting conversations with older kids about honesty, divorce, and family.

- **Age**: 8+
- **Runtime**: 125 minutes
- **Best for**: Rainy day family watch, Robin Williams fans of any age

The Babe Ruth sequence, the dog (The Beast), and "You're killing me, Smalls" are embedded in American pop culture. Essential viewing for families before kids discover organized sports.

- **Age**: 8+
- **Runtime**: 101 minutes
- **Best for**: Baseball fans, summer viewing, nostalgia for simpler childhoods

### 4. Wonder (2017)

10-year-old Auggie Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) was born with a facial condition that required 27 surgeries. When he starts fifth grade for the first time — having been homeschooled his whole life — he navigates the social complexities of middle school while his family adjusts alongside him.

**Wonder** is exceptional family filmmaking: honest about how hard social integration can be, generous toward all its characters (including those who initially hurt Auggie), and genuinely moving without being manipulative. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson are excellent as his parents.

- **Age**: 8+
- **Runtime**: 113 minutes
- **Best for**: Conversations about kindness, bullying, disability; families with kids entering new schools
