## What Happened

Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is set to become the next head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, according to multiple reports. After meeting with both the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals on Saturday, Kubiak has chosen to pursue a deal with Las Vegas.

The 38-year-old would become the Raiders' fifth full-time head coach since 2021, taking over a franchise coming off one of its worst seasons in history.

## Key Details

### Why Kubiak?

Kubiak transformed Seattle's offense into one of the league's best in his single season as offensive coordinator:

| Stat | Seahawks 2025 Rank |
|------|-------------------|
| Points per game | 3rd (28.41) |
| Total yards | 8th (351.4) |
| Passing yards | 8th (228.1) |
| Rushing yards | T-10th (123.3) |

Under his leadership, the Seahawks recorded the most regular-season wins in franchise history and are now preparing for Super Bowl 60 against the New England Patriots. Kubiak is also a finalist for the Associated Press Assistant Coach of the Year award.

### The Kubiak Football Legacy

Klint is the son of Gary Kubiak, the former Denver Broncos head coach who led the team to a Super Bowl 50 victory. The younger Kubiak has coached for six NFL teams over six seasons, including stints with the Minnesota Vikings, Denver Broncos, San Francisco 49ers, New Orleans Saints, and Seattle Seahawks.

### Raiders' Situation

Las Vegas fired former Seahawks coach Pete Carroll after a disastrous 3-14 season. The team suffered a 10-game losing streak and ranked at the bottom in every major offensive category, including a league-worst 77.5 rushing yards per game.

However, the Raiders have significant resources for a rebuild:

| Asset | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Draft position | No. 1 overall pick |
| Cap space | $81.3 million (2nd most in NFL) |
| Key players | TE Brock Bowers, RB Ashton Jeanty |
| Expected pick | Fernando Mendoza (Indiana QB, Heisman winner) |

### Tom Brady's Role

Raiders minority owner and former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has been closely involved in the coaching search alongside general manager John Spytek. Kubiak was among 15 candidates who interviewed with Las Vegas.

## Timeline

The deal cannot be finalized until after Super Bowl 60, which takes place next Sunday. The Seahawks face the New England Patriots for a chance at the franchise's second Super Bowl title.

## What's Next

If hired, Kubiak will inherit a team with the tools for a quick turnaround—cap space, draft capital, and young offensive weapons in Bowers and Jeanty. The expected selection of Fernando Mendoza with the top pick would give Las Vegas a franchise quarterback to build around.

The Cardinals, now without Kubiak as an option, will choose among their remaining finalists: Rams OC Mike LaFleur, Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver, and former Falcons HC Raheem Morris.
