## What Happened

The Cincinnati Reds have agreed to a one-year, $15 million contract with slugger Eugenio Suárez, reuniting the 34-year-old with the team where he established himself as one of baseball's most consistent power hitters. The deal includes a $16 million mutual option for 2026.

Suárez returns to Cincinnati after an impressive 2025 campaign that saw him blast 49 home runs across two teams, just missing the 50-homer mark for the second time in his career.

## Key Details

### Career-Best Power Season

Suárez dominated the first half of 2025 with the Arizona Diamondbacks, hitting 36 home runs in just 106 games and earning his second career All-Star selection. He was traded to the Seattle Mariners at the deadline for three pitching prospects.

While his numbers dipped in Seattle (.189/.255/.428 with 13 home runs in 53 games), he still finished the season with career-high 118 RBIs and a combined .228/.298/.526 slash line.

### Expected Role in Cincinnati

Suárez is expected to primarily serve as the designated hitter for the Reds, with Ke'Bryan Hayes manning third base and top prospect Sal Stewart taking over at first base full-time.

Great American Ball Park, the most home run-friendly stadium in the majors, should help Suárez replicate his dominant first-half numbers.

### Playoff Experience

The Reds valued Suárez's October experience. His go-ahead grand slam against the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 5 of the ALCS put the Mariners one win away from their first World Series appearance, though they ultimately lost the final two games.

## Career Numbers

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| 2025 Home Runs | 49 |

| HR since 2019 | 227 (6th in MLB) |

## Contract Details

| Item | Value |

## What's Next

Suárez joins a Reds team that made the postseason in 2025 for the first time in a full season since 2013. With his proven power bat and clubhouse presence, Cincinnati aims to build on that playoff success in 2026.
