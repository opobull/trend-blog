## Cold Weather Surprise in Tampa

When the NHL scheduled its Stadium Series outdoor game in Tampa for February 1, 2026, organizers expected typical Florida weather around 70 degrees. Instead, the Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins will face off in temperatures below 40°F—turning a Florida hockey game into a true winter experience.

## Players Embrace the Cold

The unexpected weather has excited players from both teams.

"Last week it was 80 or something, and this week it might be snowing at some point. So that's crazy, but also that's super exciting," said Lightning center Yanni Gourde.

Bruins defenseman Charlie McAvoy welcomed the conditions: "I heard it was going to be in the 30s, so let's hope it's maybe even colder."

Lightning coach Jon Cooper noted the unusual situation: "I think last February 1st, if I remember correctly, it was like 81 degrees in Tampa. So in the past, this has been usually a cool time of year, but I don't know if in the 13 years I've been in Tampa, I will feel the temperature as cold as it's going to be tomorrow."

## Climate-Controlled Ice Protection

To ensure playable ice conditions in Florida, the NHL implemented a first-ever solution: a climate-controlled tent over the rink during construction.

### Technical Specifications

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Structure | Steel-framed canopy |
| Length | 240 feet |
| Height | 34 feet |
| Climate Control | Air-conditioned interior |

"Sunshine, rain and humidity are all big factors, and controlling these elements for as long as possible while we're building the ice will be essential," said Derek King, NHL's Vice President of Hockey Operations.

The tent created some challenges for practice day, preventing traditional family skates and limiting players' ability to get acclimated to the outdoor rink's sight lines.

## Ice Conditions

The protective measures yielded mixed reviews. Lightning center Anthony Cirelli said the weather has been "perfect for this outdoor game" and noted the cold should help the ice quality.

However, Bruins' McAvoy was less optimistic after practice: "It's definitely pretty patchy. It's real soft... it's not great. I'm sure that they have a plan in place to make it as good as they can make it."

## Second Florida Outdoor Game This Season

This marks the second outdoor NHL game in Florida during the 2025-26 season:

| Game | Date | Venue | Result | Temperature |
|------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Winter Classic | January 2, 2026 | LoanDepot Park, Miami | Rangers def. Panthers | 63.1°F |
| Stadium Series | February 1, 2026 | Raymond James Stadium, Tampa | TBD | Below 40°F |

The Winter Classic was the warmest in history and second-warmest outdoor game ever, behind only the 2016 Stadium Series at Coors Field in Denver (65°F). Tonight's game will be significantly colder.

## Gasparilla Weekend

The game coincides with Tampa's annual Gasparilla Pirate Festival, adding to the weekend's festivities downtown.

## What It Means for Fans

Lightning defenseman Ryan McDonagh highlighted the unique atmosphere: "You need that atmosphere to be a little chilling on the breath and feel it in your lungs. Fans too here in Tampa, we obviously get so-called spoiled with the weather at times here in the winter. A little bit of chilly temps for a hockey game should do wonders for the crowd."

Coach Cooper shared his excitement for Tampa fans: "This game is meant to be played in cold weather. I think for 65,000 people... there will be a lot of people that haven't [experienced this]. And for them, I'm happy, because this is what we've experienced our entire lives on the frozen pond, outside, playing till dark."
