## The 30 Best Crime Shows on Netflix Right Now

### 1. Breaking Bad (2008–2013)
**Genre**: Crime Drama | **Rating**: 96% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 5

The greatest crime show ever made. *Breaking Bad* follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher who becomes a meth kingpin after a terminal cancer diagnosis. What starts as a desperate attempt to provide for his family evolves into a Shakespearean tragedy about pride, ego, and the corrupting nature of power.

Creator Vince Gilligan crafted a perfect five-season arc with no filler, no missteps, and a finale that sticks the landing. Cranston and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) both won multiple Emmys. The show earned 16 Emmy Awards total and redefined what TV drama could be.

**Why it's #1**: *Breaking Bad* is the blueprint. Every crime drama since has been compared to it.

**Watch if you like**: Morality tales, slow-burn storytelling, Walter White's hubris, perfect television

**Follow-up**: *Better Call Saul* (also on Netflix) is the equally brilliant prequel/sequel.

---

### 2. Ozark (2017–2022)
**Genre**: Crime Drama | **Rating**: 81% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 4

Financial advisor Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) relocates his family to the Missouri Ozarks to launder money for a Mexican drug cartel. What follows is a relentlessly tense family crime saga where no one is safe and every decision has consequences.

*Ozark* is often called "the next *Breaking Bad*," and while it doesn't quite reach those heights, it's still exceptional. Julia Garner's performance as Ruth Langmore is career-defining (she won three Emmys). The show concluded with Season 4 in 2022, delivering a divisive but definitive ending.

**Why it's #2**: The most stressful show on Netflix. Every episode ratchets tension to unbearable levels.

**Watch if you like**: *Breaking Bad*, family crime dramas, Jason Bateman against type, moral ambiguity

---

### 3. Mindhunter (2017–2019)
**Genre**: Psychological Crime Drama | **Rating**: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 2

FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (Holt McCallany) pioneer criminal profiling in the late 1970s by interviewing imprisoned serial killers. *Mindhunter* is less about shocking violence and more about the psychology of evil — slow, methodical, and deeply unsettling.

David Fincher directed four episodes and executive produced the series. The BTK Killer subplot runs through both seasons, building to a conclusion that never came — Netflix cancelled the show after Season 2, leaving fans devastated.

**Why it's #3**: The smartest crime show Netflix has ever made. Every interview scene is riveting.

**Watch if you like**: David Fincher, *Zodiac*, criminal psychology, slow burns, *Silence of the Lambs*

**Note**: Cancelled after Season 2. What exists is brilliant, but there's no ending.

---

### 4. Narcos (2015–2017)
**Genre**: Crime Biography | **Rating**: 89% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3

The rise and fall of Pablo Escobar and the Medellín Cartel, told through the eyes of DEA agents Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook) and Javier Peña (Pedro Pascal). *Narcos* blends true-crime documentary aesthetics with prestige drama, using real archival footage alongside dramatization.

Wagner Moura's portrayal of Escobar is iconic — equal parts charismatic and monstrous. The show is relentlessly violent but grounded in historical reality, which makes it even more disturbing.

**Why it's #4**: The definitive Pablo Escobar drama. Pedro Pascal's breakout role before *The Mandalorian*.

**Watch if you like**: True crime, cartel dramas, *Sicario*, anti-hero protagonists, 1980s Colombia

**Follow-up**: *Narcos: Mexico* (also on Netflix) continues the story with the Guadalajara Cartel.

---

### 5. Peaky Blinders (2013–2022)
**Genre**: Period Crime Drama | **Rating**: 93% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 6

Cillian Murphy stars as Thomas Shelby, the ruthless leader of the Peaky Blinders gang in post-WWI Birmingham, England. The show traces the Shelby family's rise from street gang to legitimate political power over six seasons.

*Peaky Blinders* is stylish, violent, and features one of the best TV soundtracks ever (modern music over 1920s visuals works shockingly well). Murphy's performance is mesmerizing, and the show's visual style is iconic.

The series concluded with Season 6 in 2022. A feature film is in development.

**Why it's #5**: The coolest crime show on Netflix. Cillian Murphy's Thomas Shelby is an all-timer.

**Watch if you like**: Gangster epics, period dramas, British crime, impeccable style, anachronistic soundtracks

---

### 6. Better Call Saul (2015–2022)
**Genre**: Crime Drama | **Rating**: 98% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 6

The *Breaking Bad* prequel/sequel follows Jimmy McGill's transformation into Saul Goodman, the morally flexible lawyer who helps Walter White. What could have been cheap fan service became a masterpiece in its own right — some argue it's even better than *Breaking Bad*.

Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn (Kim Wexler) deliver career-best performances. The show is slower and more character-focused than *Breaking Bad*, but every episode is exquisitely crafted. The series concluded with a perfect finale in 2022.

**Why it's #6**: One of the greatest TV dramas ever made. Rhea Seehorn was robbed of an Emmy.

**Watch if you like**: *Breaking Bad*, character studies, slow-burn storytelling, tragic arcs

**Note**: Watch *Breaking Bad* first for maximum impact.

---

### 7. The Lincoln Lawyer (2022–)
**Genre**: Legal Crime Drama | **Rating**: 77% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3 (Season 4 released Feb 2026)

Based on Michael Connelly's novels, *The Lincoln Lawyer* follows Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), a defense attorney who works out of his Lincoln Town Car. Season 4 dropped in February 2026, continuing Haller's high-stakes legal battles.

The show blends courtroom drama, mystery, and character-driven storytelling. It's less prestige than *Breaking Bad* or *Mindhunter*, but it's addictive legal thriller comfort food.

**Why it's #7**: The best legal crime show on Netflix right now. Season 4 just dropped.

**Watch if you like**: Legal thrillers, Michael Connelly books, courtroom drama, *Suits*, Matthew McConaughey's 2011 film

### 8. The Sinner (2017–2021)
**Genre**: Anthology Crime Mystery | **Rating**: 90% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 4

Each season follows Detective Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) investigating a different crime committed by an unlikely culprit. Season 1 stars Jessica Biel as a mother who inexplicably stabs a stranger to death on a beach — the question isn't "whodunit" but *why*.

*The Sinner* is a slow-burn psychological thriller that peels back layers of trauma, guilt, and repressed memory. Each season is self-contained, so you can start anywhere.

**Why it's #8**: The most underrated crime anthology on Netflix. Jessica Biel's Season 1 performance is extraordinary.

**Watch if you like**: *True Detective*, anthology series, psychological crime, Bill Pullman, mysteries with answers

**Start with**: Season 1 (the best season)

**Genre**: True Crime Drama | **Rating**: 98% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 1 (limited series)

Based on the true story of a series of rapes in Colorado and Washington (2008–2011), *Unbelievable* follows two detectives (Toni Collette and Merritt Wever) investigating the crimes while a teenage victim (Kaitlyn Dever) is accused of lying about her assault.

The show is devastating, infuriating, and ultimately hopeful. It's a searing indictment of how the justice system fails sexual assault survivors. Toni Collette and Kaitlyn Dever both deliver Emmy-worthy performances.

**Why it's #9**: The most important true-crime show on Netflix. Difficult to watch but essential.

**Watch if you like**: True crime, detective duos, women-led stories, social justice dramas

**Warning**: Deals with sexual assault. Sensitive content handled respectfully.

**Genre**: Heist Crime Drama | **Rating**: 97% on Rotten Tomatoes | **Seasons**: 3

The show became Netflix's most-watched non-English series when it premiered in 2021. Season 3 concluded the story in 2023, though a fourth season hasn't been ruled out.

A companion series to *Narcos*, focusing on the rise of the Guadalajara Cartel in 1980s Mexico. Diego Luna stars as Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the godfather who united Mexican drug traffickers into a single cartel.

*Narcos: Mexico* stands on its own — you don't need to watch the original *Narcos* first. Seasons 1–2 are excellent; Season 3 (post-Diego Luna) is weaker but still watchable.

**Why it's #11**: The best *Narcos* spin-off. Diego Luna's performance is magnetic.

**Watch if you like**: *Narcos*, cartel history, anti-heroes, 1980s Mexico, true crime

A criminal mastermind known as "The Professor" recruits eight criminals to pull off an unprecedented heist on the Royal Mint of Spain. *Money Heist* became Netflix's most-watched non-English series (before *Squid Game*) and a global phenomenon.

The show is pulpy, melodramatic, and insanely entertaining. Seasons 1–2 tell a complete story; Seasons 3–5 continue with a new heist at the Bank of Spain.

**Why it's #12**: The most addictive heist show on Netflix. Global cultural phenomenon.

**Watch if you like**: Heist thrillers, Spanish TV, red jumpsuits and Dalí masks, over-the-top drama

A gritty East London drug-dealing drama that follows two dealers navigating the violent world of street crime. Originally a British series, Netflix revived it in 2019 after Drake became a fan and executive producer.

*Top Boy* is raw, unflinching, and socially conscious — often compared to *The Wire* for its realistic portrayal of systemic poverty and crime. The series concluded with Season 5 in 2023.

**Why it's #13**: The UK's answer to *The Wire*. One of the best crime shows Britain has produced.

**Watch if you like**: *The Wire*, UK grime culture, street-level crime, social realism

*The Blacklist* is procedural comfort food with an overarching mystery that sustains 10 seasons. Spader's performance is the reason to watch.
