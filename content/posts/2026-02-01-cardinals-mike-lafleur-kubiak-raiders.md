## What Happened

The Arizona Cardinals have suffered another setback in their head coaching search. Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, widely considered the leading candidate for both Arizona and Las Vegas, has chosen the Raiders over the Cardinals.

Both teams met with Kubiak in Seattle on Saturday for second interviews. However, the Seahawks play-caller will work through a deal with Las Vegas after Seattle's Super Bowl run concludes.

## Cardinals' Search Troubles

This marks the latest in a series of losses for Arizona's coaching search:

| Candidate | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Klint Kubiak | Chose Raiders |
| John Harbaugh | Did not interview |
| Sean McDermott | Did not interview |
| Jeff Hafley | Became Dolphins HC |
| Robert Saleh | Became Titans HC |
| Anthony Campanile | Stayed with Jaguars |

The Cardinals are searching for their fifth head coach since 2017 and second under general manager Monti Ossenfort.

## Mike LaFleur Emerges

With Kubiak off the board, Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur becomes a key candidate. The younger brother of Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur is scheduled for a second interview with Arizona this week.

LaFleur met with Cardinals officials in Phoenix on Monday and will have his formal second interview on Tuesday.

### LaFleur's Credentials

Under LaFleur's direction, the Los Angeles Rams led the NFL in multiple categories during the 2025 regular season:

| Category | Stat | NFL Rank |
|----------|------|----------|
| Total yards per game | 394.6 | 1st |
| Total yards | 6,709 | 1st |
| Passing yards | 4,557 | 1st |
| Passing yards per game | 268.1 | 1st |
| Points per game | 30.5 | 1st |
| Total points | 518 | 1st |

This is LaFleur's third season as Rams OC. He previously served as offensive coordinator under Robert Saleh with the New York Jets for two seasons.

## Other Candidates

Several other candidates remain in contention for the Cardinals job:

**Anthony Weaver** (Dolphins DC) — Has a second interview scheduled for Sunday. Also a finalist for the Steelers job.

**Ron Rivera** — Former Panthers and Commanders head coach. Had an in-person interview with Arizona weeks ago. Rivera posted a 76-63-1 record in nine years with Carolina, including a Super Bowl appearance.

## What's Next

The Cardinals must act quickly. With only two NFL head coaching vacancies remaining (Arizona and Baltimore), the pool of available candidates is shrinking.

Arizona's 2025 season ended with a 3-14 record, including a nine-game losing streak. The franchise faces questions at quarterback and roster depth heading into 2026.
