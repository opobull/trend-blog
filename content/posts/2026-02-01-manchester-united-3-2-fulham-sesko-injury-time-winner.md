## What Happened

Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Fulham at Old Trafford on February 1, 2026, with Benjamin Sesko scoring a stunning injury-time winner in the 90+4 minute.

The match appeared to be heading for a 2-2 draw after Fulham substitute Kevin scored a spectacular equalizer in the 90+1 minute, but Sesko had other ideas as he restored United's lead just three minutes later in classic "Fergie time" fashion.

## Key Moments

### The Late Drama

The final minutes produced extraordinary scenes at Old Trafford. With nine minutes of stoppage time added, Fulham sensed an opportunity and Kevin delivered with a thunderous strike from the edge of the box to make it 2-2.

However, the drama wasn't over. Bruno Fernandes produced a moment of brilliance down the right flank, turning his marker before picking out Sesko inside the box. The striker controlled the ball magnificently before slamming it into the top corner.

### Pre-Match Fan Protests

Before kickoff, Manchester United supporters staged protests against the club's ownership outside Old Trafford, continuing their campaign for change at the club.

## Expert Reaction

Former Manchester United defender Steve Bruce, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, praised Sesko's decisive contribution:

> "Wow. If anybody needed it, it was the kid Sesko. Wonderful skill from Fernandes, he does Bassey with a dummy. Sesko's first touch is marvellous and then he smashes it in the top corner. That is what Old Trafford is all about."

Bruce also commented on the atmosphere: "That is an unbelievable amount of added time. An edgy Old Trafford."

### Kevin's Breakthrough Goal

Kevin's equalizer was notable as it marked the midfielder's first Premier League goal for Fulham. Bruce acknowledged the quality of the strike: "What an unbelievable goal. What a goal by the lad, Kevin. What an introduction to Old Trafford. He has only just come on the pitch in the last five minutes. The goalkeeper has no chance of saving it."
