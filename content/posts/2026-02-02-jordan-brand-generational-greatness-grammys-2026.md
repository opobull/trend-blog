## What Happened

Jordan Brand debuted its new "Generational Greatness" campaign during the 2026 Grammy Awards on Sunday, February 1st. The brand anthem commercial features Oscar nominee Teyana Taylor and Emmy winner Niecy Nash-Betts alongside several WNBA stars.

The campaign puts a modern spin on a classic 1991 Jordan Brand commercial that starred Michael Jordan and filmmaker Spike Lee, with the late Little Richard appearing as a genie.

## Campaign Details

### The New Commercial

In the updated version, Niecy Nash-Betts plays the genie role, while Teyana Taylor appears as part of a cast that blends athletes and entertainers. The storyline follows a woman attempting to decide which wish she wants granted, with appearances from WNBA players woven throughout.

### Featured Athletes
